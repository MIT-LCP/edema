Pertinent Results:
[**2658-4-14**] Head and c-spine CT
IMPRESSION:
1) No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No fracture.
2) Well-circumscribed lucencies within C1 without evidence of 
cortical destruction, a finding that is of uncertain 
significance.

[**2658-4-14**] CT Torso
IMPRESSION:
1. Small left pneumothorax adjacent to nondisplaced fractures of 
the left anterior third and fourth ribs and small foci of 
opacity within the anterior lingula and left lower lobe 
suggesting small areas of pulmonary contusion.

2. Complex comminuted fracture of the left acetabulum with 
associated left pelvic hematoma.

3. Fatty liver.

[**2658-4-17**] Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
Complex comminuted fracture of the left pelvis extending through 
the acetabulum with avulsed lateral fragment. Consider CT 
scanning which may be helpful in further characterization and of 
aid in treatment planning.

[**4-17**] foot films
FINDINGS:
Much detail is obscured by overlying casting material. The 
frontal view shows oblique fracture at the distal metatarsal of 
the second digit and slightly more proximally of the metatarsal 
bone of the fourth digit. No other fractures were seen.

IMPRESSION: Fractures of the second and fourth metatarsal bones 
as described above; study markedly limited by overlying casting 
material.

[**2658-4-18**]
LEFT FOOT, AP, LATERAL AND OBLIQUE: Comparison is made to 
[**2658-4-17**].

As before, evaluation is somewhat limited by the presence of 
overlying casting material. Again seen are distal metadiaphyseal 
complete oblique fractures of the second and fourth metatarsal 
bones with slight displacement at both sites. There is also a 
dislocation of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint, which was 
probably unchanged. In addition, a third fracture site is 
suspected at the base of the second phalanx along the medial 
base with probable intra-articular extension. The joint spaces 
preserved, however.

IMPRESSION:
1) Oblique fractures through the second and fourth metatarsals.
2) Suspected fracture at the base of the second proximal 
phalanx.
3) Dislocation of the fifth MTP joint.

IMPRESSION: Left lower extremity arteriography reveals patency 
of the common femoral, profunda, superficial femoral and 
popliteal arteries along with a three-vessel runoff to the level 
of the foot. No focal stenosis or occlusion was identified. At 
the foot, there is patency of the DP and PT, with a patent and 
complete plantar arch.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was seen in the ed by ortho on [**2658-4-14**] and emergently taken 
to the or for orif of left tibial shaft fx with im rodding, i/d 
debridement of left foot soft tissue injury , orif of left 
tibial malleolar fx, left leg fasciotomies and placement of lef 
leg traction pin for left acetabular fracture  - see op note for 
details. he was transfered the pacu in stable conditon. Post op. 
he was on the trauma service in the trauma sicu where he 
remained stable and was extubated. He was seen by dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] 
who explained to the patient and his family what would be the 
plan he agreed to it and he was taken on [**2658-4-19**] to the or for 
removal of a traction pin and open reduction of the left 
posterior acetabular fracture and closure of left leg 
fasciotomies, i/d of left leg soft tissue injury and placement 
of a vac dsd. He was transfered to pacu stable.  In the pacu he 
was hypotensive and required vassopressors. He was transfered to 
the tramua sicu for 24 hrs and then to the cc6 floor after being 
weaned off pressors. dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] spoke with the family again 
about the need to do another vac change prior to plastic surgery 
doing a flap closure  on [**2658-4-23**] he returned to the or for i&d 
and a pinning of his metatarsal fx on [**2658-4-26**].  He again 
returned to the or for i&d  vac dressing change and orif of the 
left anterior acetabular fx dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that his foot 
looked better the swelling was going down he was now made non 
weight bearing but may be oob to chair on [**2658-4-28**] he returned to 
the or and underwent a vac change.  The wound looked good and 
was starting to have some granulation tissue form  he returnedto 
the or on  [**2658-5-1**]  had vac removed  on [**2658-5-5**] he had dressing 
change and then on [**2658-5-7**] had vac dsd placed.  Plastic surgery 
was consulted and dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a multiple skin grafts to 
his open areas on his left foot. post-operatively, he was 
transferred to the plastic surgery sergice. Patient was placed 
on stirct bed rest and had the vac in place until post op day 5 
([**2658-5-18**]). In the interim, the plastics team eventually weaned 
him off the iv pains medications to regular po pills. He appears 
to be well controlled on oxycontin 30bid and dialudid po for 
breakthrough. His foley was did on morning of the 11th and his 
donor skin graft site was kept open to air. His vac was removed 
on post-op day 5, [**5-18**] which revealed that the foot had 
taken to the multiple skin graft sites. The thought was to place 
the patient in a AFO splint with ortho's approval and prior to 
discharge to rehab. However, the patient failed to tolerate 
splint as the current pins in his left foot limited his flexion. 
After discussion with ortho, they recommended discharge with his 
foot as is with range of motion as tolerated. They intend to 
take the pins out of his left foot when he returns for a 
follow-up appointment a week after discharge. They are aware of 
the patients foot being in plantar flexion and will work on 
placing patient in splint after pins are removed.  The patient 
was tolerating a regular diet, on po pain medication and iv 
antibiotics. He awaited for placement until [**5-26**] at which time 
he was discharged to rehab with followup appointments at the 
[**Hospital1 19**].
