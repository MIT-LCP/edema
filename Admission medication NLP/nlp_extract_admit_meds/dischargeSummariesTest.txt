Brain MR:
1. Innumerable nodular enhancing foci predominantly in a 
watershed distribution in the cerebrum but also within the 
cerebellum with associated edema. A focus of restricted 
diffusion in the right posterior parietal region without 
evidence of minimal hemorrhage appears to represent a small 
associated infarction. Given the watershed distribution, small 
vessel vasculitis should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis. The appearance and distribution is not classical for 
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The differential diagnosis 
also includes an unusual encephalitis, sarcoidosis, or other 
granulomatous disorder.

2. Normal Circle of [**Location (un) 449**] MRA.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and managed for her headache and loss 
of consciousness.  She was initially intubated and sent to the 
NICU.  Her head MRI showed multiple white matter lesions 
consistent with a leukoencephalopathy of unclear etiology.  An 
LP was done which was unrealing.  A rheumatology consult was 
obtained to help us work up a possible cerebral 
vasculitis/angitis.  An EEG showed bursts of generalized 
slowing. A brain biopsy was performed which showed "acute 
hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy".  She was started initially on 
iv steroids and then switched to po steroids in addition to 
seizure prophylaxis with phenytoin.  Her neurologic exam 
improved over the course of her stay to where she was more alert 
and oriented.  Her speech became more fluent.  She still 
remained with a mild left hemi-neglect and weakness in the 
distal left extremities.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 44 yo man with h/o HTN and hyperlipidemia who was
transferred after a fall down [**5-19**] stairs last night.  He was
found to have bifrontal SAH and bifrontal contusions.  He also
has a temporal bone fracture.  He was awake there, but mumbling
and not speaking coherently.  He was found to have EtOH of 391
there.  His C-spine CT was without fracture and he was sent here
for further evaluation.

He is currently arousable only by mild nox stim and does not
verbalize to me or follow commands.  He is aware of his
surroundings and quickly pulls away from me when examined.  He 
is
unable to provide any further history of the fall.  From the
records, he had been drinking and then slipped on a rug and fell
backwards down [**5-19**] stairs.  He had a LOC of unknown time frame
and had no reported seizure activity.  He was awake and moving
all extremities at OSH, but not able to hold a conversation.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and responds to nox stim by opening eyes 
and
telling us to get away.
Otherwise, no language output due to his sleepiness.  He
withdraws rapidly from all stim. in ext or trunk.

Cranial Nerves:

Pertinent Results:
[**3-24**] CT Orbit, sella and IAC
-Extremely limited study secondary to motion. Likely 
subarachnoid and  
 subdural hematoma. Bifrontal contusions also noted.
-Bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions. Low density of brain 
paranchyma could
 be due to cerebral edema. Basal cisterns are patent.
-Fluid in the right auditory canal and mastoid air cells, and 
the
 prestyloid spaces suggest basilar skull fracture although no 
definite
 depressed fracture is identified.

[**2982-3-24**]  Head CT
-Extremely limited study secondary to motion. Likely 
subarachnoid and
 subdural hematoma. Bifrontal contusions also noted.
-Bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions. Low density of brain 
paranchyma could
  be due to cerebral edema. Basal cisterns are patent.
-Fluid in the right auditory canal and mastoid air cells, and

[**3-24**] CT abd/pelvis
-No evidence of acute traumatic injury.
-Cirrhosis, with multiple varices and collateral vessels.
-Multiple hypoattenuating lesions seen scattered throughout the 
liver, possibly representing regenerative nodules although 
incompletely characterized on this study. Tumor cannot be 
excluded and nonemergent MRI would be recommended for further 
evaluation.

[**3-24**] CXR:
No evidence of displaced fractures or pneumothorax.

[**3-25**] Head CT:
-Direct comparison to prior study is slightly limited; however, 
bifrontal
 contusions appear larger on today's study. Surrounding 
hypodensity
 suggests vasogenic edema.
-Subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma also again noted, 
with high- density material now seen layering within the 
ventricles bilaterally.
- Fluid again seen within the right auditory canal with 
persistent fluid in the mastoid air cells, again suggesting a 
temporal bone fracture.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 461**] is an 84-year-old
gentlemen with a history of coronary artery disease, status
post multiple stents to his left anterior descending on
[**3163-10-25**] at [**Hospital6 173**] and diabetes,
who was transferred here to [**Hospital6 102**] from [**Hospital 462**] Hospital for cardiac catheterization.
The patient reports the onset of substernal chest pain at
11:30 p.m. associated with diaphoresis.  The patient took
three sublingual nitroglycerin with no relief of the chest
pain.  He went to the outside hospital where an
electrocardiogram revealed 1-1.5 ST elevations in leads V3
through V5 and ST depressions with T wave inversions in I and
aVL.  A Heparin drip and nitroglycerin drip were started and
the patient was given aspirin and Lopressor in the Emergency
Department with hopefully resolution of his chest pain.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital6 273**] pain
free and had a cardiac catheterization performed that
revealed a left dominant system.  D1 osteo 98% with TIMI II
flow, OM2 90%, left posterior descending artery 90% mid focal
stenosis, 90% right coronary artery.  A D1 osteal stent was
placed.  A mid vessel stent was also placed followed by
multiple wounds inflations in the left anterior descending,
kissing balloon inflations in the left anterior descending
and D1 with TIMI III flow in each vessel.  He was then
transferred to the floor for further observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post interior myocardial
infarction, status post catheterization in [**3163-10-25**] at
[**Hospital6 173**].  PCI and stent to his left

This is a Discharge Summary Addendum from previous discharge
summary.

Regarding the patient's possible adrenal insufficiency, after
discussion with the endocrinology consult and with patient's
A.M. cortisol level of 12 on the morning of [**5-7**] prior to a
dose of 20 mg of prednisone, it is most likely that patient
is not adrenally insufficient given that she has a normal
cortisol level.  It was recommended by the endocrinology team
that patient continue on a prednisone taper of 20 mg q day
for the next day, [**5-8**], and then taper to 10 mg q day
afterwards starting on [**5-9**] until patient can have a follow
up appointment with the endocrinologist.

At the time of this dictation an endocrine appointment is
still being scheduled depending on whether the patient would
like to stay close to home or whether she can return to [**Hospital1 471**] for follow up.  Patient will
no longer need fludrocortisone so this was discontinued.  She
will need [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 472**]-stem test on her endocrine follow up
appointment while she is a dose of prednisone 10 mg a day.
In addition, it is important that note that patient will
require stress dose steroids in the event of an infection or
other stress given that she has been on high dose steroids
which may have suppressed some adrenal function.  So place
make the correct that patient's prednisone taper will not be
as dictated in the pervious Discharge Summary but will be
spelled out on the .  All other discharge medications are the
same as previous Discharge Summary.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 157**] 
Chief Complaint:
s/p recent fall with "inability to walk."
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
#L2-S1 laminectomy, foraminotomy, facetectomy, irrigation, for 
severe spinal stenosis and epidural abscess on [**2907-1-28**].
#C2-C7 laminectomy, irrigation for epidural abscess.  C3-C7 
posterior instrumentation and fusion for cervical instability on 
[**2906-2-3**].
#Aspiration of retropharyngeal abscess.
#Chest tube placement for pulmonary empyema.
#Bilateral knee arthrocentesis, partial synovectomy, surgical 
debridement and washout for septic joints on [**2906-2-5**].

L4-L5 and repair of dural leak on [**2906-2-20**].

 
History of Present Illness:
pt is a a 55 F with h/o RA (on methotrexate, enbrel, prednisone) 
and spinal stenosis who presented to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**2907-1-27**] s/p 
recent fall with "inability to walk." Pt apparently had 
developed increasing weakness of her lower extremities with some 
urinary incontinence. Upon arrival to ED pt was treated with 
narcotics for pain of the left lower extremity and back, and 
developed mental status changes. Her O2 sats acutely dropped, 
(etiology unclear, [**3-5**] narcotics versus infiltrate), with 
tachycardia to 140s, hypoxia to 88%, and CTA showing RLL/RML 
opacity but no PE. Pt was intubated for airway protection and 
transferred to MICU.  
.  
MRI spine on [**1-27**] revealed severe L3-L5 spinal stenosis for 
which pt underwent lumbar decompression of L2-S1 on [**1-28**] with 
gross pus evident in epidural space. X-ray of the foot revealed 
left ankle fracture, for which she was placed in a walking cast. 
She also had cervical and retropharyngeal abscesses, for which 
she underwent cervical decompression and drainage of cervical 
abscesses, from C2-C7, with instrumentation and fusion from 
C3-C7, on [**2906-2-3**]. Retropharyngeal abcesses were drained, and 
she had bilateral knee arthrocentesis and washout for septic 
joints. Pt was treated with vancomycin after nafcillin resulted 
in rash (pt seen by derm, termed "drug hypersensitivity"). In 
addition, on [**1-29**] pt noted to have SVT, with rate up to the 
160s, and SBP decrease. She was cardioverted x2 and started on 
amiodarone, which has since been discontinued. Pt seen by 
cardiology, without apparent further recommendation.  
.  
Pt most recently taken to OR on [**2906-2-20**] for debridement of 
postoperative lumbar wound, and decompression of L4-5 and repair 
of dural leak after pt was persistently febrile and MRI of 
lumbar spine showed fluid collection (+GPC per aspiration). Pt 
last febrile on [**2-20**].  
.  
Pt exubated on 1/16 per notes, and now breathing comfortably on 
RA. Lower extremity weakness appears largely resolved, though pt 
signficantly deconditioned [**3-5**] hospitalization. Per ortho/spine, 
pt full weight bearing, though must wear hard cervical collar at 
all times, and TLSO brace whenever out of bed.

IMAGING:
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2906-1-27**] 6:01 PM
1. No major organ injury in the abdomen.
2. Bilateral acute and chronic rib fractures as described above, 
as seen on the prior chest CT.
3. Bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis as seen 
on the prior CT.
4. Small left retroperitoneal fluid.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2906-1-27**] 11:40 AM
1. Airspace opacities in the lower lobe and right middle lobe 
with volume loss suggesting atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be 
completely excluded on the radiology basis.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions. 
3. No pulmonary embolus identified.
4. Multiple old fractures of the ribs bilaterally at different 
stages. Some are clearly healed, some are healing and some 
appear somewhat acute. Clinical correlation is recommended.
.
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2906-1-27**] 5:56 PM
At L2/3, moderate canal stenosis due to degenerative changes and 
epidural lipomatosis. At L3/4 and L4/5, severe canal stenosis 
and severe right foraminal stenosis due to combination of 
degenerative changes, disk herniations, and epidural 
lipomatosis.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2906-1-27**] 8:45 AM
Bibasilar atelectasis with possible infiltrate at the right 
base.
No other obvious acute findings.
.
ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT  [**2906-1-27**] 7:04 AM
1. Base of fifth metatarsal fracture.
2. Possible nondisplaced distal fibular fracture.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2906-1-27**]  4:23:48 PM   
Sinus tachycardia 
Right bundle branch block 
Low voltage 
Inferior ST segment elevation suggestive of inferior myocardial 
infarction 
Since previous tracing of [**2905-12-28**], inferior changes are new - 
clinical 
correlation is suggested 
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2906-1-29**]   
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and  
cavity size are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 477**] W& W/O CONTRAST  [**2906-2-6**] 9:43 PM
1. Overall improved prevertebral area of abscess seen on [**2906-2-1**]. 
Secondary to inadequate post-contrast T1-weighted images, the 
tissue remaining in this area could represent either persistent 
abscess versus postoperative changes. If clinically indicated, a 
repeat, contrast-enhanced scan could be performed.
2. Unchanged intraspinal epidural signal that overall appears 
less extensive compared to previous exam.
3. New hyperintense signal at the T2 to T3 interspace could 
represent progression of discitis.
4. Likely bilateral pleural effusions. Infectious etiology 
cannot be ruled out based on these images secondary to poor 
post-contrast study.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2906-2-26**] 9:55 AM
Interval placement of right-sided PICC line with tip in the 
right atrium.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to ED pt was treated with narcotics for pain of the 
left lower extremity and back, and developed mental status 
changes.  Her O2 sats acutely dropped, (etiology unclear, [**3-5**] 
narcotics versus infiltrate), with tachycardia to 140s, hypoxia 
to 88%, and CTA showing RLL/RML opacity but no PE.  Pt was 
intubated for airway protection and transferred to MICU.  
.
MRI spine on [**1-27**] revealed severe L3-L5 spinal stenosis.  X-ray 
of the foot revealed left ankle fracture, for which she was 
placed in a walking cast.  She also had cervical and 
retropharyngeal abscesses, and was transferred to the SICU.
.
SICU Course
Pt was admitted to SICU post-operatively after L3/L4 & L5/s1 
decompression/laminectomy for epidural abscess on [**1-28**].
Neuro: PT was admitted with altered MS, and was maintained on 
propofol while intubated for sedation.
.
CV: PT had episode of SVT on [**1-29**], was shocked twice and 
returned to [**Location 478**] was consulted and recommended 
amiodarone, which was d/c'd prior to transfer to floor.  Pt had 
a TEE on [**2-9**] that was negative for thrombus (concern for septic 
emboli).  Pt also had an IVC filter placed on [**2-9**] for PE 
prophylaxis.  Pt was maintained on lopressor with tight BP 
control while in the SICU, and she had no further cardiac 
issues.
.
Resp: Pt was extubated initially on [**2906-1-31**], but was 
re-intubated on [**2906-2-1**] [**3-5**] respiratory distress.  On [**2-4**], pt had 
R VATS/decortication/washout for R empyema, and on [**2-12**] pt had a 
pleural tap; the pleural fluid from [**2-4**] grew MSSA, and the 
pleural fluid from [**2-12**] was no growth.  Additionally, the pt had 
2 [**Doctor Last Name 479**] drains post-operatively that were pulled on [**2-11**] and 
[**2-17**].
.
Musculoskeletal: Pt had L3/L4 and L5/S1 
laminectomy/decompression on [**1-28**], on [**2-2**] pt had C5-6 ACDF 
w/ICBG & Post Cervical decompression for cervical prevertebral 
abscess, on [**2-4**] pt had knee tap with MSSA and subsequent bilat 
knee washouts (left knee was not infected - the drains were 
d/c'd on [**2-6**].  On [**2-19**], pt went to IR for drainage of L3,4,5 
collection (approx 10cc out).  On [**2-20**], pt returned to OR w/ 
ortho spine for debridement of postoperative lumbar wound, and 
decompression of L4-5 and repair of dural leak after pt was 
persistently febrile and MRI of lumbar spine showed fluid 
collection (+GPC per aspiration).  Pt last febrile on [**2-20**].
.
ID: Pt was initially started on nafcillin/gentamicin; initial Cx 
were positive for MSSA and pt was maintained on nafcillin until 
[**2-8**], when she developed a drug rash and was changed to 
vancomycin.  Additionally, on [**2-13**] pt developed papular rash 
over posterior thighs and peri-rectal area and was started on 
acyclovir.  Pt was intermittently febrile without obvious source 
throug much of ICU stay, but was afebrile for several days prior 
to transfer to floor.  Her pertinent Cx data is below: 
.

GI: While patient was intubated, she was started on tubefeeds 
for nutrition; following extubation, pt was advanced to a 
regular diet without problem.  Pt was maintained on GI ulcer 
prophylaxis with H2-blocker while in the ICU.   
.
Medicine Floor Course
.
#Neuro: mental status improved spontaneously.  Neuro exam 
stable.  CN2-12 intact, MAE. 4/4 strength B/L uppers, left > 
right.  LE grossly intact bilaterally.  wiggles left toes.  hip 
flexion, knee flexion and extension [**2-5**] b/l.  [**6-5**] [**Last Name (un) 480**] and 
plantar flexion of right LE.  left LE wiggles toes, mobility 
limited by cast.  Per ortho/spine, pt full weight bearing, 
though must wear hard cervical collar at all times, and TLSO 
brace for 6 weeks whenever sitting up unsupported or out of bed. 

-Vancomycin was continued per ID recs for multiple abcesses, at 
least 8 week duration s/p [**2-20**] debridement. Hardware cleared for 
repeat MRI if needed. 
.
# ID: last fever on [**2-17**] was 102.3, pt was followed by ID for 
multiple spinal abcesses, on vancomycin for MSSA given pt had 
rash in reaction to nafcillin (seen by derm, "drug 
hypersensitivity reaction" on [**2906-2-8**]).  Pt was placed on 
acyclovir for perianal ulcers which grew HSV 2 on [**2906-2-13**], but 
this was d/c'ed [**2906-2-23**]. Leukocytosis trending down with normal 
diff.  Prednisone for RA as above, but further immunosupression 
was avoided. Vancomycin was continued for now, plan for 8 week 
course s/p last debridement on [**2906-2-20**].  Vancomycin end date is 
[**2906-4-19**]. A psoas abcesses was too small to drain per IR.  
Bilateral knee swelling s/p arthrocentesis and washout decreased 
over time, without redness tenderness.
Needs weekly CBC w/diff, BUN/creat ratio, vanco trough.
.
# PULMONARY: pt initially presented without respiratory 
symptoms, however was intubated in ED [**3-5**] increasing mental 
status changes (?[**3-5**] narcotic medications) for airway 
protection.  subsequent CT showed ?right side pneumonia.  Pt 
extubated on [**1-31**] s/p OR for spinal procedure, then reintubated 
on [**2-1**] (presumably [**3-5**] developing empyema felt [**3-5**] septic emboli 
for which pt went to OR on [**2-4**] for VATS and chest tube 
placement, though not clear), and extuabted on [**2-16**].  Presntly, 
pt without SOB, on RA.  chest tube removed [**2-22**], and CXR s/p 
removal showing small right side effusion, no PTX, no pneumonia. 
 O2 was weaned, and ipratropium nebs continued.   
.
# CARDIAC: Pt was placed on telemetry.  Episode of SVT on [**2-25**] 
to 120s, no chest pain or SOB.  EKG showed sinus tachy, old RBBB 
and new ST depressions in V3, V4 and inferior leads.  ST 
depressions quickly resolved.  Troponin and CK-MB were negative 
x 3.  Metoprolol increased in house to 75mg PO TID. ASA was 
started.
.
# RENAL: pt with foley in place, presumably placed given initial 
urinary incontinence, however, pt may be able to urinate on her 
own now.  for now will continue foley given pt difficulty on 
bedpan.  creatinine trending downward from 1.1. on admission to 
0.5 presently, likely represents loss of muscle mass. 
.
# GI: pt with h/o hiatal hernia, on omeprazole at home. Did not 
have complaints of abdominal pain presently, LFTs and alk 
phosphate mildly elevated on admission, now within normal 
limits.  Pt tolerating regular diet without difficulty.  Per 
intervential radiology, psoas abcess too small to drain.  
Lansoprazole continued given steroid regimen. 
.
# GU: no urinary complaints presently, foley in place presumably 
[**3-5**] incontinence earlier during admission.
.
# ENDO:  pt on prednisone chronically for RA, and initially 
received pulse dose of steroids (hydrocort/fludrocort) given 
concern for adrenal insufficiency.  insulin sc sliding scale was 
dc/d on [**2-27**] due to blood sugars less than 150 for 24 hours.  
pt seen by endocrine service who recommend minimum dose of 
prednisone 10mg po qdaily give almost certain component of 
adrenal insufficiency.  home regimen of prednisone 15mg qdaily 
(home regimen for RA) was continued
.
# PAIN: pt with h/o LBP [**3-5**] spinal stenosis, and myofascial pain 
syndrome.  pt being seen by pain service during this admission.  
 pt on ultram, oxycodone, and indomethacin at home.  Was placed 
on hydromorphone transiently, but this decreased her alertness.  
now on percocet [**2-2**] tab PRN, fentanyl patch, standing 
acetaminophen and ibuprofen with meals
.
# RHEUM: Pt with h/o RA, on enbrel, methotrexate, indomethacin, 
sulfadiazine (?) at home, however (except prednisone) all are 
being held presently in light of multiple infections.  Knee exam 
without obvious effusion presently, healing well s/p 
athrothrocentesis.  will follow for now and encourage PT.  
Continued on nsaids for RA. DMARDS were not restarted due to 
abscesses. Should followup with her outpatient rheumatologist.
.
# PSYCH: Pt with h/o anxiety and depression, presently somewhat 
anxious, especially during movement, transition to sitting.  
Ativan was continuedprn. 
.
#FEN: Advanced to regular diet with ensure for increased caloric 
intake.  Mg and K were replete lytes as needed. 
.
#PPx: Pt was given lovenox and IVC filter for DVT prophylaxis. 
PPI given steroid regimen. Bowel regimen
.
# DC to Rehab.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: airspace disease? atelectatsis? 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with PEEP of 10, then bedside trach placement 
today, now with sats of 90-92 (worse than prior when on 
endotracheal tube). ? atelectasis. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
airspace disease? atelectatsis? 
EXAMINATION: AP chest.

INDICATION: Hypoxia.

A single AP view of the chest was obtained on [**2958-4-28**] at 1245 
hours and is compared with the radiograph performed the prior 
evening at 2025 hours. The patient has had removal of an ET tube 
and a tracheostomy placed. When allowing for technical 
differences there likely has been no significant change in the 
appearance of the chronic pulmonary disease together with 
superimposed mild interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural 
effusions.

IMPRESSION:

Stable appearance to the chest following tracheostomy.

[**4-24**] ECHO:
Conclusions:  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is [**3-30**]  
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic 
function are  
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion  
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber 
size is milldy  
increased with normal free wall motion. The aortic valve is not 
well seen.  
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral  
valve is not well seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There 
is mild  
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred to the TSICU once stabilized in the ED and 
admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery was consulted 
because of his subarachnoid hemorrhage; the injury was non 
operative. Serial head CT scans were followed and were stable. 
He remained in the TSICU and initially was difficult to wean 
from the ventilator; the decision to perform a tracheostomy and 
placement of a PEG tube was made. He underwent both procedures 
without any complications. He was eventually weaned from the 
ventilator.

Because of his head injury there were initially some behavioral 
problems; complicating this was his history of EtOH use. He was 
placed on a CIWA protocol for alcohol withdrawal, this was 
discontinued after 9 days. Haldol was started to help control 
his intermittent episodes of agitation; this was found to be 
very helpful. His mental status and behavior improved over the 
next several days.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have 
recommended rehab after hospital stay. He will need a Speech and 
Swallow evaluation once at rehab for Passy Muir and swallowing 
eval.

He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Clinic in 2-3 weeks for 
possible removal of his trach and PEG if he passes the Speech 
and Swallow evaluation.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure, non ST elevation
myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia, who developed a cough five days prior to
admission.  She was started on antibiotics one day prior to
admission secondary to being short of breath.  The patient
was at an outside hospital on [**2-10**], was intubated,
became hypotensive and started on Dopamine, briefly found to
be pulseless in the field.  At that time, echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 20 percent with anterior
hypokinesis.  CK checked at that time was 3000, MB was 60,
troponin was 2.6.  An emergent catheterization showed patent
grafts, however, severe congestive heart failure with
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34.

On admission to [**Hospital1 10**] the
patient was found to be in cardiogenic shock with a low
cardiac output and high SVR.  Cardiac output improved on
dopamine although the patient developed ATN and shock liver
with AST in the 10,000 range.  Urine output improved on
vasopressin.  On [**3433-2-12**], the patient was
transitioned to Milrinone and Levophed but was tachy to the
140s and hypotensive.  The patient then developed atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate versus atrial
tachycardia without any response to adenosine.  The patient
was cardioverted on amiodarone but the amiodarone drip was
discontinued secondary to liver failure.  The numbers on
[**2-12**] were more consistent with sepsis with a cardiac
output of 5.0 and an SVR of 704.  The patient was switched
back to Levophed and Dopamine and then titrated off Dopamine.

On [**2-13**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with
a heart rate in the 170s with shocks times two and loaded on
digoxin.  Throughout this course, the patient has been on
broad antibiotics for a questionable sepsis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Significant for coronary artery disease status post
   coronary artery bypass graft in [**3428**].
2. Questionable diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
3. Hypertension.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6. Status post mitral valve replacement, bioprosthetic valve.


MEDICATIONS:
1. Nitroglycerine.
2. Aspirin.
3. Pletal 100 q day.
4. Lasix 20 q day.
5. Protonix 40 twice a day.
6. Lopressor 25 three times a day.
7. Lisinopril 5 q day.
8. Pravachol 80 q day.
9. Pulmicort.
10.Serevent.
11.Albuterol three puffs four times a day.


LABORATORY DATA:  Cardiac catheterization at the outside
hospital on [**2-7**] showed right atrial pressure of 16,
left ventricular end diastolic of 21; pulmonary artery
pressures 51/33; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 34.  Left
main coronary artery with mild disease.  Left anterior
descending with diffuse disease.  Left circumflex with mild
disease; right coronary artery with proximal total occlusion;
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and left
anterior descending were patent.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  No significant lesions in graft
   on catheterization.  CK was elevated 3000 and MB of 60;
   the MB index was around 5 percent.  The patient was
   started on aspirin and started on a statin when her liver
   function tests improved.

1. PUMP:  Repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction
   of 20 percent with global left ventricular hypokinesis.
   Initial concern was for cardiogenic shock; however, the
   patient continued to spike fevers and physiology was more
   concerning for sepsis.  Managed with broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a two week course.  The patient remained
   tachycardic during most of the hospital course.  Once the
   pressors were weaned, able to initiate an ACE inhibitor
   and low dose beta blocker and titrate as tolerated by
   blood pressure.

1. RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation versus supraventricular
   tachycardia versus atrial arrhythmia.  Heart rate elevated
   to the 170s on [**2-12**].  Initially controlled with
   carotid massage; given 12 mg of Adenosine without
   significant effect.  On [**2-13**], systolic blood pressure was
   in the 70s, heart rate was in the 170s.  The patient was
   shocked times two, given bicarbonate, calcium gluconate,
   titrated up on Levophed and started on digoxin.  The
   patient needed anti-arrhythmic loading but limited by
   hepatic toxicity and blood pressures, so therefore the
   patient was started on digoxin.  When liver function tests
   improved, the patient was subsequently placed on
   amiodarone and was subsequently in sinus rhythm.

1. HYPOTENSION:  Initially presumed to be cardiogenic, but
   hemodynamics later were more consistent with sepsis and
   blood pressure and cardiac output improved with fluid
   boluses.  The patient was weaned off Levophed but
   exquisitely sensitive to small changes in dose
   questionably thought to be secondary to autonomic
   dysfunction.  Random cortisol was 6 and improved to 22 on
   corticotropin stim test.  The patient was treated with
   hydrocortisone times seven days, given low random cortisol
   but not thought to be adrenally insufficient.  Hypotension
   improved with volume.  The patient was able to be weaned
   from pressors.  Blood pressure stabilized and the patient
   was able to be started on low dose ACE inhibitor and beta
   blocker.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Persistent fevers, septic physiology.
   A chest x-ray was without infiltrate.  Urinalysis remained
   negative.  Blood cultures were negative to date.  Concern
   for sepsis given increased cardiac output and dropping
   SVR.  The patient was continued on Vancomycin,
   Levofloxacin and Flagyl for broad coverage empirically
   times two weeks on the antibiotics which were renally
   dosed.  Surveillance blood and fungal cultures were
   negative.  After a two week course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics, the patient started to produce sputum
   positive for E. Coli.  The patient was treated with a two
   week course of Ceftaz  (Cultured E. Coli was found to be
   fluoroquinolone resistant) with the improvement in white
   blood cell count and downward trend in fever curve.  The
   pathogen was thought to be from a new ventilator acquired
   pneumonia versus prior infectious etiology for sepsis.

1. GASTROINTESTINAL:  Evidence of shock liver with
   transaminases in the 10,000 range and concerning for bowel
   ischemia given guaiac positive stools.  Right upper
   quadrant ultrasound was performed without any gross
   abnormalities.  As perfusion formed, liver function tests
   normalized and bowel function returned.  Given the concern
   for guaiac positive stools, the patient had an EGD and
   colonoscopy.  EGD showed a 1 to 2 centimeter mass in the
   esophagus and mild gastritis in the stomach body.
   Colonoscopy showed non-bleeding rectal ulcer thought to be
   the cause of the guaiac positive stools.  Hematocrit at
   the time of discharge was stable.

1. NUTRITION:  Once bowel function returned, the patient was
   started on tube feeds to assist her catabolic state.  Once
   extubated, Speech and  Swallow evaluation ultimately
   cleared the patient for taking a regular diet.  At the
   time of discharge the patient was tolerating p.o. intake.

1. PULMONARY:  Evidence of congestive heart failure by chest
   x-ray and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
   Oxygenation has not been an issue during this hospital
   course.  The patient was intubated prior to arrival and
   extubated on [**2-27**], oxygenating and ventilating well.
   She received a two week course of antibiotics with
   ceftazidine for E. coli pneumonia.

1. RENAL:  Acute renal failure / ATN from shock.  Post ATN
   diuresis.  The patient's creatinine improved.  At the time
   of discharge, the renal function was stable.

1. THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  First noted on [**2-14**].  HIT antibody
   was negative, however, H2 blocker was stopped.  There was
   no evidence of DIC.  The patient was restarted on
   subcutaneous heparin and platelets remained stable
   throughout the remainder of her hospital course.

1. NEUROLOGIC:  The patient remained sedated for much of the
   hospital course and minimally responsive.  Sedative
   medications (Versed and Fentanyl) were discontinued for 96
   hours without significance starting on [**2-20**].  At
   that point, there was no significant improvement in mental
   status.  The thought was that the patient had taken large
   hit to liver and renal function secondary to sepsis /
   shock.  Since many of these medications are hepatically
   metabolized and renally cleared, it was thought that the
   patient was not clearing these medications quickly.  The
   patient was started on Dilantin with thoughts that there
   may have been seizure activity; however, this did not seem
   to make acute improvements in mental status.  Towards the
   end of the hospital course, the patient's mental status
   improved.  The patient was more awake and alert,
   interactive at the time of discharge.  The patient
   demonstrated marked weakness secondary to immobilization,
   however, neurologically intact.

1. DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was given a Regular
   insulin sliding scale.

1. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE:  The patient was status post
   right femoral-popliteal bypass.  To continue aspirin and
   Pletal.

1. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient's
   electrolytes were monitored and ultimately she was started
   on tube feeds.  At the time of discharge she was
   tolerating p.o.

1. CODE STATUS:  At the time of presentation, the patient was
   full code and during hospital course the patient was
   changed to DO NOT RESUSCITATE.  At the time of extubation,
   the patient was changed to DO NOT RESUSCITATE, DO NOT
   INTUBATE.
