HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] is a 72-year-old
gentleman with a history of Hodgkin's disease was transferred
here from [**Hospital3 773**] Hospital because of intractable seizures
and decreased mental status.

He was in his usual state of health, active and playing golf,
until [**8-16**] when he began to become "confused" and developed
gait difficulties.  According to the family, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] was
behaving in a way that was perceived to be nontypical by family
members. He was also having gait difficulties that were
considered to be mild, according to the family members.

Because of these symptoms, he was evaluated at [**Hospital3 773**] Hospital
on [**8-16**]. At that time, a head computed tomography was
reported as normal. He was give a diagnosis of transient ischemic
attacks and was d/c home.

Over the next three days, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8352**] problems gradually
worsened.  On [**8-19**], he was at home when he developed a
nonfocal onset of seizure which was later generalized.    He
was transferred to the nearest Emergency Department where he
continued to have generalized seizures.  He was given a
Dilantin load and phenobarbital.  His systolic blood pressure
at that time ranged between 120 and 200s.

A repeat head CT was reported to be normal. Despite the Dilantin
load and the phenobarbiltal, the patient continued to have
clinical seizured. Therefore, he was started on an Ativan drip
and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. His Dilantin was
also continued on therapeutic levels.  Despite the Ativan drip
and Dilantin therapeutic levels, Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] continued to be
unresponsive and had intermittent seizures. The rate of the
Ativan IV infusion was increased and the patient was intubated. A
lumbar puncture was performed on [**8-19**] at [**Hospital3 773**] Hospital
and showed normal values.

A MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging showed diffuse
hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex (R > L) and both thalami.

At this point, the patient remained intubated and unresponsive
and was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 33**] for further evaluation and
care.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [**2676-4-9**] after
developing a respiratory infection.  This was diagnosed as
nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease; stage III-B with
positive [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells.  A bone marrow biopsy was done
in [**2676-8-9**] which showed no bone marrow involvement.
2.  Status post chemotherapy with bleomycin, Cytoxan,
vincristine, and procarbazine two years ago.  This had to be
discontinued after three cycles because of interstitial lung
disease and because of myelosuppression with episodes of
neutropenic fever.  Most recent surveillance computed
tomography scan revealed gradual interval progression of
Hodgkin's disease with slightly large mediastinal lymph[**MD Number **].
3.  Borderline hypertension.
4.  Colonic polyps.
5.  Tuberculosis.
6.  Cataracts.
7.  Macular degeneration.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Prevacid, and Tylenol.
Ativan drip and Dilantin were started at the outside
hospital.

ALLERGIES:  CEFTIN (causes a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a retired chemistry teacher
and lived in [**Hospital3 773**].  He was married with no alcohol or
intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of [**Hospital1 33**] on
[**2677-8-21**]. A repeat LP on admission showed normal cells, glucose
and protein. A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures
and different viral and fungal Ab titers (including West Nile
Virus, Arboviruses, HSV, HBVs). Routine cultures for bacterial,
TB and other infectious agents were also normal. Cytology was
normal.

Despite the therapeutic levels of PTN and the IV infusion of
Ativan, electroencephalogram (EEG) on admission showed
epileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoing
epileptict activity. Therefore, a Penotarbital infusion was
started. The Pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain a
burst- suppression pattern on bedside 24 h, EEG monitoring. In
particular, the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10
seconds. Dilantin and Depakote were continued as well. At this
point, pressors were started to compensate to the Pentobarbital-
induced decreased cardiac function.

Mr [**Known patient lastname 8351**] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance
imaging examination ([**8-23**]) showed multicentric areas of T2
hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as
well as bilateral thalami. Laboratory studies throughout Mr.
[**Known patient lastname 8352**] admission included several blood cultures, urine cultures
and extensive toxic metabolic workup. Another LP for
cerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection, toxic metabolic and
cytological analysis was also performed.

In order to better elucidate the underlying pathology. A brain
and meningeal biopsy was performed on [**8-23**] in the right
frontal lobe.

In regards to empiric treatment, after the brain biopsy, the
patient received IV Solu- Medrol and high doses of antibiotics
with broad coverage.  The Infectious Disease team was also
involved in the care of Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**]. All the tests performed on his
tissues and fuids obtained under request of the ID team, had
thus far come back normal.

Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic
eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal
damage (red neurons). There was no evidence of an infectious
[**Doctor Last Name 82**] on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.

Several attempts in decreasing the dose of Pentobarbital resulted
in an increased epileptiform activity on bedside EEG monitor.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8352**] condition deteriorated even further. He had developed
ileus, and his abdomen was hyperextended.  He had been intubated
throughout his entire stay in the Intensive Care Unit and was
increasingly dependent on ventilatory support.

At this point, the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosis
was thoroughly discussed with his closest family members. After
a family meeting, it was decided that Mr. [**Known patient lastname 8351**] would no longer
benefit from aggressive support.  Therefore, he was extubated
and expired briefly thereafter.

Service:  Neonatology


IDENTIFICATION:  [**Known patient lastname 1267**] "Baby Girl [**Known patient lastname 1268**]" is a 45 day old
former 31 [**4-7**] week premature infant who is being discharged
from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 3**].

HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known patient lastname 1268**] was born on [**2856-10-10**] as the 1655
gram product of a 31 [**4-7**] week gestation pregnancy to a 34
year old gravida III, para 0 to I mother with estimated date
of confinement of [**2856-12-7**].  Prenatal laboratory studies
included blood type A positive, antibody negative, hepatitis
B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune
and group B strep unknown.  Maternal history notable for
Clomid assisted pregnancy.  The pregnancy was complicated by
preterm premature of membranes on [**2856-9-24**], leading to
maternal admission to the hospital and maternal treatment
with antibiotics and betamethasone.  Mother developed
increasing abdominal pain on the day prior to delivery
leading to concerns for infection and prompting induction of
labor.  Delivery was by cesarean section secondary to arrest
of dilatation.  Mother did receive several doses of
antibiotics just prior to delivery.  Infant emerged vigorous
with Apgar scores of 7 and 8 and was brought to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit on oxygen.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial examination was
notable for a weight of 1655 grams, length of 39 cm, and head
circumference of 28.5 cm.  Examination revealed a well
developed premature infant overall consistent with 31 to 32
weeks gestational age.  Infant exhibited moderate respiratory
distress with increased work of breathing and coarse breath
sounds.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. RESPIRATORY:  Infant was initially placed on CPAP for
   evidence of hyaline membrane disease.  However, secondary
   to increased oxygen requirement, the infant was intubated
   at approximately six hours of age and then received a
   total of two doses of surfactant.  The infant did well and
   was extubated to CPAP at 24 hours of age.  Infant remained
   on CPAP until day of life four at which time she was
   weaned to room air.  The infant has remained on room air
   since that time without significant evidence of
   respiratory insufficiency.  The infant did exhibit mild
   evidence of immaturity of respiratory control with
   occasional apnea, bradycardia and desaturation episodes.
   The infant was not treated with caffeine and these
   episodes gradually resolved over time.  The infant has not
   had an apneic or bradycardic episode at rest for
   approximately two weeks by the time of discharge.  The
   patient did exhibit evidence of discoordination with
   feedings with occasional desaturations and bradycardic
   episodes during feeds; however, these also improved by the
   time of discharge.  The infant had no feeding related
   events for five days.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  The infant remained hemodynamically
   stable throughout admission.  The infant did not exhibit
   hypotension or significant concerns for a patent ductus
   arteriosus.  Intermittent murmur was heard over the course
   of the hospitalization; this was not evaluated in detail
   and a murmur was not present by the time of discharge.

1. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The infant was
   maintained on intravenous fluids and then begun on
   parenteral nutrition.  Enteral feedings were introduced on
   day of life 2 and were advanced without difficulty.  The
   infant received a parenteral nutrition for a total of five
   days and reached full enteral feedings by day of life
   number seven.  Calories were subsequently increased to a
   maximum caloric density of 28 calories per ounce of breast
   with added ProMod.  The feedings were initially given by
   gavage tube with oral feedings gradually introduced and
   advanced as tolerated.  With excellent weight gain caloric
   density of breast milk was slowly decreased.  By the time
   of discharge the infant is being given 24 calories per
   ounce made with Similac powder, taking it all by mouth
   with total intake of 150 to 180 cc per kilogram per day
   with excellent weight gain.  Recent growth parameters
   include weight of 2785 (inc 60g) on [**2856-11-24**], head
   circumference of 33 cm on [**2856-11-20**] and length of 47.5 cm on
   [**2856-11-20**].
   Electrolytes were periodically monitored throughout
   admission and remained within normal limits.  The infant
   is on Vi-Daylin at the time of discharge, 0.1 cc by mouth
   q. Day.

1. HEMATOLOGY/INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  A CBC and blood culture
   were sent on admission.  CBC included a white count of
   14.5 thousand with a differential of 23 percent
   neutrophils and 0 percent bands.  The hematocrit was 48.2
   and platelet count was 392.  The infant was begun on
   Ampicillin and Gentamicin; these were discontinued after
   48 hours with a negative blood culture and overall benign
   clinical course.  On day of life six an abrasion to the
   back of the right leg was noted with a small amount of
   surrounding erythema concerning for early cellulitis.
   Sputum stain growth culture were sent; blood culture
   returned negative.  Infant was treated with five days of
   antibiotics initially with Vancomycin and Gentamicin and
   then with Keflex with prompt resolution of the lesion.  No
   further infectious disease issues were noted throughout
   the hospitalization.  The infant was begun on iron after
   reaching full feeds and continues on supplemental iron at
   the time of discharge.  The last hematocrit was on [**2856-11-4**]
   and was 34 percent with a reticulocyte count of 2.6
   percent.

1. NEUROLOGY:  The patient has had a normal neurologic
   examination throughout admission.  A head ultrasound on
   day of life nine was normal.  A repeat ultrasound on day
   of life 29 was also normal.  Initial ophthalmology
   examination on [**10-30**] revealed immature retinas in zone 3;
   a follow up examination on [**11-21**] revealed mature retinas
   without evidence of retinopathy.  Follow up was
   recommended in nine months.

1. OTHER:  The infant was noted to have developed two small
   hemangiomas over the course of hospitalization.  One is on
   the scalp is the other is on the left leg.  These are
   small hemangiomas approximately 1 to 3 mm in size and have
   not changed significantly during the hospitalization.

1. ROUTINE HEALTH CARE MAINTENANCE:  The infant received
   hepatitis B vaccination on [**2856-11-7**].  The infant received
   the first dose of Synagis on [**2856-11-23**].  The infant passed
   a hearing screen on [**2856-11-20**].  The infant passed a car
   seat placement test on [**2856-11-22**].  Newborn screenings have
   been sent per protocol with the last one done on [**2856-11-21**]
   and have been unremarkable to date.

1. DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight on [**2856-11-23**] was
   2725 grams.  General:  The infant is a well developed
   premature infant in no distress.  The infant is
   comfortable and active with examination.  Fontanelles are
   soft and flat.  Sutures are appropriately apposed.  Palate
   is intact.  Ears and nares are normal.  Red reflex is
   present bilaterally.  Lungs are clear to auscultation with
   minimal evidence of increased work of breathing.  Cardiac
   examination is regular rate and rhythm without murmur or
   gallops.  Abdomen is soft and nontender with active bowel
   sounds.  A small umbilical hernia is present.  Genitalia
   was that of normal female without rash or lesions.  Hips
   and back are normal.  Tone and activity are appropriate.
   Moro, grasp and suck reflexes are intact.  Two small
   hemangiomas are noted over the scalp and left leg.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Vi-Daylin 1 cc by mouth once a day.
2. Fer-In-[**Male First Name (un) 55**] 0.2 cc by mouth once a day.

Date of Birth:   [**2620-12-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

ADDENDUM:  This is a discharge summary from [**2653-3-28**] to
[**2653-4-7**].  Please see prior discharge summary from date
[**2653-3-27**] for further details.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 33-year-old woman with no
significant past medical history who was admitted for dilated
cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure likely from
postpartum state.

1.  PUMP/CARDIOMYOPATHY:  The patient from [**2653-3-28**] to
[**2653-4-7**] was started on Captopril at a dose of 6.25 mg and
was initially started on a t.i.d. basis but could not
tolerate it and was switched to a b.i.d. basis.  The patient
was also started on a low-dose beta blocker in the form of
carvedilol and was given a dose of 1.5 mg twice a day.

Over the course of ten days, the patient slowly began to
tolerate more doses of her medications.  Upon discharge, she
was tolerating b.i.d. doses of both medications.  The
patient's medication was occasionally held due to low blood
pressure.  The patient was also started on digoxin on
[**2653-4-3**] and was loaded with 0.25 mg for inotropy.  The goal
digoxin level for the patient will likely be between 1.5 and
2.0 nanograms for inotropic effect.

The patient will be discharged to the [**Hospital 3630**] for evaluation for cardiac transplant given her
minimal improvement during the past several months.

The patient had her workup for her cardiac transplant done
including PFTs and several viral studies which were negative.
Her PFTs showed an FVC of 83% predicted, FEV1 of 94%
predicted, FEV1 to FVC ratio 114% predicted, DLC 88%
predicted, and a DLCO of 83 to 89% predicted.

2.  RHYTHM:  The patient had an ICD revision on [**2653-4-1**] due
to malfunctioning leads.  The patient had a 41 joule
implantable cardioverter defibrillator placed on [**2653-4-1**].
The procedure was without complications.  This was placed
given her significant cardiomyopathy as potential for
arrhythmia.  The patient was also started on low-dose Lasix
given her recurrent ascites and pulmonary edema.  She was
started on 10 mg p.o. q.d. of Lasix which helped remove
excess fluid from her cardiomyopathy.

The patient also developed a hematoma at the original ICD
site and anticoagulation was held until the hematoma
improved.  After the replacement procedure on [**2653-4-1**], the
Electrophysiology Service recommended anticoagulation be held
for ten additional days until [**2653-4-11**].  At that point,
anticoagulation can resume for her risk of thrombus given her
low ejection fraction.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have a
right lower lobe effusion with a possible infiltrate and was
given a seven day course of levofloxacin for questionable
pneumonia.  She finished the course on [**2653-4-3**].  The
patient's chest x-ray resolved over a period of a week and
she had improvement in her lung volumes and decrease in her
pleural effusions bilaterally.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was noted to be slightly
hypothyroid and was started on low-dose Levoxyl 25 micrograms
and needs to have an outpatient TSH level rechecked in
approximately two to three weeks.  The patient's TSH level
was 9.8 and free T4 was 1.4.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to be iron-deficient
with an iron level of 50 and a ferritin of 89.  She was given
approximately [**1-28**] units of red blood cells during her
hospital stay and started on low-dose oral iron 325 q.d.  Her
hematocrit remained stable, greater than 30 for the remainder
of the hospital stay after receiving blood products.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had occasional
constipation and intermittent abdominal pain.  The abdominal
pain was thought most likely secondary to both a small amount
of ascites and gas pain.  Serial KUBs were done which were
all negative for signs of obstruction.  She was given an
aggressive bowel regimen which helped improve her symptoms
and also put on p.o. Lasix which also helped to improve her
symptoms.  The patient had poor p.o. intake most of her
hospital stay felt secondary to poor appetite.  She was given
Boost supplements which she occasionally tolerated.  She was
also given simethicone for her gas pain.

DISPOSITION: The patient was seen by physical therapy and was
walked and exercised on a regular basis once she was on the
hospital floor and tolerated many of the exercising and was
able to walk greater than 100 feet and a flight of stairs.
The patient was to be transferred to the [**Hospital 3630**] for further evaluation for cardiac transplant on
[**2653-4-7**].

DISCHARGE STATUS: Stable, able to tolerate some exercise with
no chest pain, no rest shortness of breath.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to
postpartum state.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 q.d.

Date of Birth:   [**2567-12-6**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIAC THORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
female referred for an outpatient cardiac catheterization
prior to aortic valve replacement and mitral valve
replacement.

The patient has been experiencing dyspnea on exertion over
the several months prior to admission and had to reduce level
of activity.

An echocardiogram done in [**2647-2-13**] showed aortic
stenosis (with 48-mm peak gradient across the aortic valve,
and 28 mean gradient across the aortic valve), severe mitral
regurgitation with thickened mitral valve leaflets, and an
ejection fraction of 70% to 75%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past Medical History includes)
1.  Atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin); last dose on [**8-30**].
2.  Anemia.
3.  Gastritis.
4.  Right leg vein ligation.
5.  Right hip replacement.
6.  Right shoulder replacement.
7.  Esophageal strictures.
8.  GERD. Mild Chronic obstructive lung disease.
9.  Question of transient ischemic attack in the past.
10. Congestive heart failure, Severe mitral regurgitation,
11. Aortic stenosis. peripheral vascular disease.
 ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient underwent
catheterization on [**2647-9-1**]. Post catheterization,
she suffered hypotension to a systolic pressure of 70 mmHg,
but she remained asymptomatic. A lower abdominal CT scan
showed no abnormality. The patient had an
aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement on
[**2647-9-2**] using a 19-mm pericardial aortic valve and
a 25-mm pericardial mitral valve.Intraoperative TEE showed
normal LV and RV function and good prosthetic valve function.
Initially, the patient did very well, but she had a large
fluid requirement and she developed abdominal swelling. She
required pressor support to maintain her BP and her peripheral
perfusion diminished. 

The patient returned to the operating room on postoperative
day zero for ventricular tachycardia arrest and acidosis. 
The patient suffered a cardiac arrest but was rapidly
resuscitated. In the OR, TEE again showed normal LV and RV
function, but her abdomen continued to swell and she required
increasing fluid and pressor requirement to maintain her BP.
An intraaortic balloon pump was placed despite her PVD. After
the second operation she continued to have episodes of
hypotension, problems maintaining [**Name2 (NI) 3181**] pressures, problems
maintaining pH, and problems maintaining SAO2.
The patient developed bleeding rectally and from her NG tube.
General surgery was consulted but she was felt not to be a
surgical candidate by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] because of her critical
condition. It was felt that she had ischemic bowel, ischemic
liver dysfunction and renal failure and that her prognosis was
poor regardless of treatment. 
The patient's condition continued to deteriorate despite
aggressive treatment, and prognosis was grave.  After
discussion with the family and per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision
was made to withdraw support.
The patient expired at 11:05 a.m. on [**2647-9-3**].

Once again, after discussion with the family and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
the decision to have any autopsy done was agreed upon and
will be performed.

Admission Date: [**3132-7-26**]        Discharge Date: [**3132-8-2**]

Date of Birth:  [**3053-10-26**]        Sex:  F

Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year old female
patient being worked up for a carotid endarterectomy.  Found
to have a positive exercise tolerance test.  Subsequently
referred for cardiac catheterization and was found to have an
80 percent left main coronary artery stenosis as well as a 70
percent to 80 percent circumflex and 100 percent right
coronary artery with collateral.  She was referred for
coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for known coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**3122**],
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, status post
deep venous thrombosis with an IVC filter placed, status post
bilateral mastectomies due to fibrocystic breast disease,
status post cataract surgery, and status post right total hip
replacement.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol 50 mg by mouth once per
day, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg by mouth once per day, Lipitor
20 mg by mouth once per day, Norvasc 5 mg by mouth once per
day, aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day, Zestril 20 mg by
mouth once per day, vitamin B6, folic acid, and potassium
replacement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone but has family that
lives close by.  Her alcohol intake is very rare.  She denies
ever having smoked.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient under evaluation
from the Neurology Stroke Service to evaluate her carotid
disease and risk for stroke undergoing coronary artery bypass
graft.  After subsequent evaluation by the Neurology Stroke
Service as well as the Interventional Cardiology Service to
assess the patient's carotid artery disease, she underwent a
carotid angiography.  It was felt that the patient did not
need to have a carotid stenting procedure done prior to
coronary revascularization.

She was ultimately taken to the operating room on August
____, 2004 where she underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times three with a LIMA to the LAD a saphenous vein
graft to the PDA and a saphenous vein graft to the OM by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14**].

Postoperatively, she was transported from the Operating Room
to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good condition on a
propofol drip.  On the night of surgery, she was weaned from
mechanical ventilation and subsequently extubated.  She
remained hemodynamically stable, requiring some pulmonary
toilet issues.

On postoperative day one, her chest tubes were discontinued.
She remained on low-dose Neo-Synephrine for some hypotension.
On postoperative day two, she remained hemodynamically stable
on vasoactive drip.  She began to advance ambulation and
mobility and was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit
to the telemetry floor on postoperative day three on 4 liters
nasal cannula oxygen at that time.

The patient continued to progress from a mobility standpoint
and cardiac rehabilitation; however, she continued to
progress slowly and was not able to ambulate independently at
this time.  She has remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint.  Felt to be in the patient's best interest that
she continue to progress with her mobility and independence
issues in a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On postoperative day five, her condition
is good.  Her temperature was 98.8, her blood pressure was
128/55, her heart rate was 95 (normal sinus rhythm), her
respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 93
percent on 1 liter nasal cannula.  Her weight today was 72.9
kilograms (up slightly from her preoperative weight of 71
kilograms.  Most recent laboratory values from today included
a hematocrit of 28 and a potassium of 4.2.  Her chest x-ray
from approximately 48 hours previously showed bibasilar
atelectasis with a very small left effusion.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
2. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
3. Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice per day.
4. Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
5. Lasix 20 mg by mouth twice per day (times seven more
   days).
6. Percocet 5/325 one tablet by mouth q.6h. as needed (for
   pain).
7. Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
8. Lopressor 25 mg by mouth twice per day.
9. Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth once per day.


DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with her
primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6340**]) in approximately
one to two weeks or upon discharge from rehabilitation.  The
patient was also to follow up with her primary cardiologist
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1245**]) in one to two weeks.  She should follow up
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14**] from Cardiothoracic Surgery in
approximately five weeks for a postoperative evaluation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Carotid artery stenosis.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  She is being discharged to a
rehabilitation facility for further progression of  mobility
and cardiac rehabilitation.

pain related to inspiration.  CXR:  mild pulm vascular 
congestion and free air under R diaphragm.  Bilat nodules 
consistent with mets.  Normal EKG.  Blood pressure better 
controlled with oral regimen and pt responding well to Lasix.  
Pt seen by Heme/Onc to discuss tx options.

POD#3 Pt transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 873**] 12.  Pt responded well to 
diuresis, but remains slightly wet.  Adv diet to sip from 
clears.  Restart all home meds.  Weaning off of O2.  Per cards, 
cont lisinopril and 0.125 dig.  

POD#4 Pt still with scant bibasilar crackles.  Sat @ 97% on 2L 
NG.  Continuing with oral HTN meds and Dig.  OOB and ambulating 
with walker.  

POD#5 Pt depressed about diagnosis.  Sat 98% RA at rest.  
OOB/AMB with walker.  ADAT.  Following Dig and BNP levels per 
cardiology.  Dispo planning.  Nutrition recommends  boots 
supplements.

POD#6 Pt feels anxious this AM.  No overnight events.  Sat 92% 
on room air and Sat 86% on RA while ambulating.  CXR: consistent 
with volume overload.  EKG: no changes from prior tracings.  Pt 
diuresed per cardiology recommendations.  Discussed findings of 
EKG, CXR and pt's symptoms with cardiology fellow and attending.

POD#7 Pt doing much better this AM.  Pt Sat 100% while 
ambulating with PT.  PT feels pt no longer needs home PT.  Pt 
safe to be discharged to home with services.  Pt discharged on 
oral HTN meds per cardiology.  Discussed with pt the importance

DETAILS OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Known patient firstname **] [**Known patient lastname 7526**] was a chronically
ill patient with end-stage renal disease and multiple medical
problems who is admitted to an outside institution and became
quite ill with a significant congestive heart failure, fluid
overload and inability to undergo dialysis due to catheter
malfunction. She was transferred to this facility for further
management. Upon arrival at our institution she was admitted
to the surgical intensive care unit where she was found to be
profoundly hypotensive, intubated and was placed on pressors.
Her pupils were noted to be dilated bilaterally. She had
minimal brainstem reflexes. She underwent a CT scan of the
abdomen and chest which demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary
embolus. She had findings consistent with a low flow state to
the mesentery but no evidence of a frankly gangrenous bowel.
Neurology was consulted. Based upon the patient's
neurological status and found that her examination was
consistent with brain death. Based upon the fact that she had
received medications with altered mental status full 24 hours
was waited for a second brain death examination. The patient
eventually expired on [**2759-2-14**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient was the 708-gram product
of a 24-4/7 weeks gestation born to a 38-year-old gravida 3,
P0-1 mother.  Prenatal screens were notable for a O positive
blood type, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, rubella immune, group B Strep status unknown
mother.  There was no significant past maternal history until
mother presented with preterm labor that was not responsive to
tocolysis.  She received a single dose of  betamethasone and
ampicillin for three doses.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 413**] [**First Name (Titles) 4111**] [**Hospital3 198**].

The infant was delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery.  [**Known patient lastname **]
emerged with a weak cry and spontaneous breaths.  [**Known patient lastname **] was
brought to the warmer, dried, suctioned, and stimulated.
Apgars were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  The patient
was intubated in the delivery room with a 2.5 endotracheal
tube without complications.  

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory:  The patient was
initially intubated and given three doses of surfactant.  [**Known patient lastname **]
was initially treated with high frequency oscillatory
ventilation.  [**Known patient lastname **] was weaned to conventional ventilation on
the second hospital day.  Clinical evidence of a patent
ductus arteriosus was treated with indomethacin on the second
hospital day.  Echocardiogram on [**12-20**] showed no evidence of
PDA.  Patient remains without murmur on the day of transfer.
The patient developed hypotension on [**12-22**] when [**Known patient lastname **] developed
necrotizing enterocolitis and bowel perforation.  [**Known patient lastname **] was
treated with dopamine peaked up to 10 mcg/kg/min - this was
weaned quickly - off on the [**12-23**] - required restart on the 9th
early AM and is currently on 6mcg/kg/min.
Caffeine was started on the second hospital day and dc'ed on
the the 6th.

Ventilator settings this morning, day of transfer, including
a PIP of 18/5 rate 30, and FIO2 24-30%.  Last ABG 7.37/63/63
this morning.
 
Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient was initially
maintained nothing by mouth.  Trophic feedings were begun on
[**12-21**] and stopped on [**3395-12-23**] with the development of presumed
necrotizing enterocolitis.  Total fluids are at 150 cc/kg/day.
PN/IL(88ml/kg/d), also running are a fentanyl drip, and
dopamine drip and peripheral arterial line in the left radial.
[**Known patient lastname **] has also been receiving replacement for peritoneal drainage
- NS with 3 mEq of KCL per 100cc.     
Drained 8 cc overnight.  [**Last Name (un) 379**] output was 4 ml in past 24
hours.  DS have been 98-104.  The baby did have hyperglycemia
up to 336 treated with 1 dose of insulin with good resolution
and no further insulin required.
Lytes - 4AM 141 4.4 94 28 from [**3395-12-27**] BUN 38 Cre 0.6     
 
Gastrointestinal:  As noted above, the patient was begun on
trophic feeds on the 5th hospital day.  These were tolerated
without the exception of small bilious aspirates being noted.
Feedings were discontinued and the baby has been NPO with
continuous [**Last Name (un) 379**] suction since then.
On the morning of 01/05, the patient was noted to have
continued bruising of the lower abdominal wall.  There was
excoriation above the umbilicus without evidence of
infection.  Baby was diagnosed with intestinal perforation
with free air present on KUB.  [**Known patient lastname **] was treated with surgical
placement of a peritoneal drain at the bedside on the night of
1/5 by Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) 138**].  The baby has continued to have a
discolored blue [**Doctor Last Name **] abdomen.  Distension had improved however
over the past 24 hours has worsened.  Because of worsening
status with persistant thrombocytopenia, decision made with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 138**] to send to the OR for surgical exploraion.
   
Hyperbilirubinemia:  Patient was treated with
phototherapy  - peak bili 4.2/0.6 on [**3395-12-22**] - most recent bili
1.6/0.9 this morning - rebound.

Infectious disease:  Patient was begun on antibiotics
ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of delivery.  Initial
white count was 9.9 with 29 polys and 0 bands.  Patient
remained neutropenic with a white blood cell count of 4.3 on
the [**2-17**] and similar count of 4.3 with 29 polys and
0 bands on the morning of 01/04.  
Blood cultures:  
[**12-22**]  - source arterial line - coagulase negative staph 
[**12-23**]  - blood - positive for [**Last Name (un) 10544**] albicans 
[**12-26**]  - source art line - negative so far 
[**12-22**]  - peritoneal culture taken with placement of drain -
positive for [**Female First Name (un) 1101**] albicans
 
CSF exam done on [**12-22**] showed 170,000 red blood cells and 0
white blood cells.  It was resumed that this was a traumatic
tap and not reflective of blood within the CSF.  Blood
culture from admission and the CSF culture remains negative.
 
Neurological:  Initial head ultrasound on [**12-20**] showed no
evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage.  Cerebral cortex was
consistent with the early gestational age.  There was notation
of a large cisterna magna.  This exam was repeated on [**12-24**]
and [**12-27**] with no IVH or other abnormality - the cisterna magna
and cerebellum were within normal limits on follow up studies.
     
Social:  Parents are fully involved with the patient's

Date of Birth:   [**3225-5-11**]       Sex:  F

Service:

She is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female, who presented to the hospital on
[**3322-3-31**] to the medical service with vomiting and
anorexia.  Her presentation was weakness, lethargy, nausea,
and vomiting.  She was studied with a barium esophageal study
and found to have a large hiatal hernia, and she has been
refusing to eat with significant weight loss despite being
started on Reglan.

She was evaluated by a CT scan of her abdomen which showed
that she had a large hiatal hernia and a partial small bowel
obstruction with a transition point in the mid to distal
ilium without extrinsic compression or a mass and a left
thyroid lesion.  At that time, several attempts at
nasogastric were unsuccessful, however, during her prolonged
and complicated hospital stay, she did have some improvement
with decreased vomiting and nausea.  She was also noted to
have some lethargy and some facial droop.

A head CT scan on [**4-7**] showed no acute bleeding but
questionable lucency in the skull, and further workup was
deferred.

The Gastroenterology service also had been consulting on her,
and it was decided that there would be no acute surgical
intervention to try to resolve this partial bowel
obstruction.  She had electrolyte abnormalities as well which
were corrected for a high sodium and high chloride, which is
likely the result of the same process.

A chest CT scan showed a low attenuation lesion in the left
thyroid.  The pelvis CT scan showed scattered colonic
diverticuli and some uterine calcifications.

Patient had a PICC line placed, and was given supplemental
nutrition.  A Speech and Swallow evaluation resulted in
patient continuing on NPO status and not being fit for po
intake. Thus, enteral feeding option was explored and it was
determined on consultation with the Medical Team who is
taking care of her, that the surgeons will be contacted
regarding placement of some G or J tube.  It was decided that
the patient would go to the operating room where she was
looking slightly better during a very long hospital stay in
conjunction with a family meeting.

So on [**4-17**], the patient was taken to the operating room
with a preoperative diagnosis of aspiration and dysphagia
along with a partial small bowel obstruction.  She underwent
lysis of adhesions and enterostomy and a feeding jejunostomy
placed.  Intraoperative findings were multiple adhesions and
strictures of the small bowel secondary to these adhesions in
the distal small intestine, has required a small bowel
resection and postoperatively, the patient was brought to the
Intensive Care Unit, and despite having TPN, she never
regained her bowel function, and she postoperatively, had
some issues with atrial fibrillation.  Was treated with beta
blocker and some amiodarone, and was in the Intensive Care
Unit for several days until approximately a half an hour
before her death where she became decreased in her blood
pressure and noted to have agonal respirations.

Daughter was contacted at that time to inform her in the
change in her mental status.  She shortly thereafter, despite
fluid, did not recover blood pressure, respirations dropped
over to 0 and she was pronounced dead.

DISCHARGE:  Death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Partial small bowel obstruction.
2. Status post lysis of adhesions.
3. Status post enteroenterostomy.
4. Status post jejunostomy tube placement.
5. Failure to thrive.
6. Hypernatremic.
7. Hyperchloremic.
8. Hypertension.
9. Chronic venous insufficiency.
10. Constipation.
11. Left ventricular hypertrophy.
12. Pulmonary hypertension.
13. Osteoarthritis.
14. Diverticulosis.
15. Questionable cerebrovascular accident.

ADDENDUM TO PREVIOUS DICTATION

ADDENDUM TO HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious Disease.  The patient remained afebrile
throughout his stay.  Repeat blood and urine cultures were
negative.  As per the recommendation of the Infectious
Disease Team the Klebsiella found in the patient's urine was
felt to be a contaminant and was not likely thought to be a
cause of acute infection.  Beta streptococcus.  The patient
will be treated for an aspiration pneumonia with p.o.
Clindamycin and Levofloxacin for two to four weeks with a
final duration pending the approval of the Infectious Disease
service.

2.  Pulmonary.  The patient continued to undergo aggressive
chest physical therapy as much as possible and required face
mask oxygen.

3.  Endocrine.  The patient will be tapered slowly on
Prednisone.

4.  Hematology. The patient's Coagulase studies began to
trend down.  He was restarted on his outpatient regimen of
Coumadin.  This will need to be followed.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
CODE STATUS/DISPOSITION:  Extensive discussions were held
with the patient's family including Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] brother,
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known patient lastname **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3162**].  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] family reinstated
their desires for the patient to be "DNR/DNI including no
re-intubations, pressors, or transfers to the medical
Intensive Care Unit.  Because of the patient's poor overall
functional state and significant chance of a repeat similar
admission the patient's family felt strongly about he not be
hospitalized again for these problems.  He will be given
p.r.n. Morphine for comfort.

NOTE:  This is a discharge summary addendum.

HOSPITAL COURSE [**3368-8-13**] through [**3368-8-16**]:  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**3368-8-13**] and
stayed overnight with a low grade fever to 100.8�� and
tachycardia, but no change in white blood cell count.  His
Levaquin was discontinued, as the pseudomonas was found to be
resistant to it.  He was then switched to vancomycin and
cefepime for antibiotic coverage.  He spiked a temperature to
101.2�� on [**8-15**] at 0400.  Chest x-ray was done at that time
which showed increased left lower lobe consolidation which
was consistent with pneumonia and worsened from prior chest
x-ray.  Therefore, the patient's antibiotic course was
changed to cover for pneumonia (hospital acquired versus
aspiration) instead of previous treatment for
tracheobronchitis.  Antibiotic coverage was extended for a 14
day course of vancomycin cefepime.  It was pathogen directed
against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus
and Pseudomonas, all of which showed moderate growth on
sputum culture from [**3368-8-9**].

A PICC line was placed under fluoroscopy due to need for long
term antibiotics on [**3368-8-15**].  The 1 of 4 positive blood
cultures from [**8-10**] was identified as gamma strep.  No further
speciation was made.  Per microbiology lab, this was "very
likely" to be a contaminant.  On further testing, it was
identified as not being Enterococcus and therefore assumed to
be skin flora and susceptible to current antibiotic regimen.
Since transfer to the floor on [**3368-8-13**], the patient's sputum
production decreased dramatically.  Respiratory therapy
continued with prn albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers and
aggressive suctioning, however very little secretions were
suctioned.  He was continued on his tube feeds at a goal of
85 cc an hour.  He was non responsive for a majority of the
time on the floor, however, he followed simple commands on
one occasion.  His hematocrit dropped slightly from 40 on
admission to 30 on discharge which was thought to be
secondary to dilution with intravenous fluids, especially
given patient's hypovolemia on admission.  No source of
active bleeding was identified and his hematocrit was stable
for the five days prior to discharge.

Due to worsening edema in his right arm just prior to
transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, a Doppler
study was performed on the right upper extremity which was
negative for deep venous thrombosis.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed
future plans with the patient's daughter and it was decided
to consider tracheostomy in the future to avoid further
aspiration events.  DNR status was also discussed and the
patient remains full code.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Multi-infarct dementia
2.  Hypertension
3.  Recurrent urinary tract infection
4.  Pneumonia
5.  Diabetes
6.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy with chronic suprapubic
catheter
7.  Decubitus ulcer x2 - chronic (right hip and sacrum)

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lansoprazole 15 mg po qd
2.  Colace 100 mg po qd
3.  Scopolamine transdermal change q 72 hours
4.  Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers prn wheezing
5.  Cefepime 1 gm q 12 hours, day 4 of 14, first dose
included with patient on discharge.
6.  Vancomycin 1 gm q 12 hours a day for 14, one dose
included with patient at time of discharge.
7.  Regular insulin sliding scale per flow sheet
8.  Aspirin 81 mg qd
9.  Multivitamin 1 tablet qd
10. ProMod with fiber at 85 cc an hour

FOLLOW UP:  Patient is to be discharged back to [**Hospital3 4327**] Home with follow up to be arranged per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable and improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon presentation to the emergency room for hypotension and 
diabetic ketoacidosis, immediately admitted to the intensive 
care unit for close monitoring.  Upon  admission, many tests, 
including cardiac enzymes were drawn which revealed CK-MB 
peaking at 130 and Troponin peaking at 15 [NSTEMI].  Cardiology, 
as well as Renal, was immediately consulted.  Cardiac working 
including an angiogram reveal 2-vessel disease.  

A CT of the abdomen done on day two showed pancolitis without 
evidence of intra-abdomenal abscess colections.  His 
electrolytes and blood sugars quickly normalized with 
hemodialysis and insulin drip/sliding scale.  He stayed in the 
Intensive Care Unit for five days total, and was then 
transferred to the cardiac floor.  There, he was continued to be 
closely monitored with telemetry.  On day nine of his 
hospitalization, he had a successful angioplasty of the right 
coronary artery.

Feeling well and doing well, he was discharged on the [**1-31**], 2006 good condition.  His intructions for follow up was very 
throrough and specific.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old
gentleman status post a coiling of a right middle cerebral
artery aneurysm on [**2524-3-26**] and a known small left cerebellar
artery origin aneurysm.  The patient reports a sudden onset
of sharp pain and headache in the left frontal region.  Took
Ibuprofen with some relief but headache still persists.
Denies visual changes, stiff neck.  No nausea or vomiting.
Did report some unsteadiness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature is 99.5, blood
pressure 126/73, heart rate 103, respiratory rate 24, sats
97% on room air.  The patient is awake, alert and oriented
times three.  Speech is fluent.  Pupils are 3 down to 2 mm
equally reactive bilaterally.  EOM's are full.  No nystagmus.
Face is symmetric.  Normal sensation in the face.  Tongue is
midline.  Sternocleidomastoid's full.  Sensation intact to
light touch in the upper and lower extremities with slight
decrease in the left upper extremity which the patient states
is old.  His strength is [**3-29**] in all muscle groups.  His
reflexes are 2+ throughout and his toes are downgoing.  Gait
is steady.

Head CT shows no hemorrhage or mass affect.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  HIV, urinary frequency, tuberculosis,
herpes zoster, PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 9078**].

The patient is admitted to the neurosurgical service and
underwent an angiogram on [**2524-6-17**] for a coiling of the left
superior cerebellar artery aneurysm without complication.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated
and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for close
neurologic observation.  He remained neurologically intact.
His groin is clean, dry and intact.  He had positive pedal
pulses.  He was transferred to the floor on postop day one,
he has been out of bed ambulating, tolerating a regular diet,
voiding spontaneously.  He had a repeat head CT on [**2524-6-19**]
that was stable, which did show some elevation of his
ventricles which has been stable since his CAT scan in May.
The patient did complain of pain behind the left eye at that
time.  The head CT is essentially unchanged with no evidence
of hemorrhage or stroke and the patient was discharged on
[**2524-6-20**] in stable condition with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 281**] in

Date of Birth:  [**2946-4-18**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NB


HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] [**Known patient lastname 503**] [**Known patient lastname 11810**] delivered at 35-5/7-
weeks gestation with a birth weight of 2080 and was admitted
to the newborn intensive care unit for management of
prematurity and respiratory distress.

The mother is a 34-year-old gravida 1, para 0 now 1 mother
with estimated date of delivery [**2946-5-18**]. Her prenatal
screens included blood type O-positive, antibody screen
negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR
nonreactive, rubella immune, and group B strep unknown. The
pregnancy was complicated by uterine fibroids and
intrauterine growth restriction. The delivery was prompted by
poor growth with delivery by cesarean section under spinal
anesthesia due to the transverse lie of this infant. There
was no labor. Membranes are ruptured at delivery, with clear
fluid. No maternal fever. No intrapartum antibiotic
prophylaxis.

At delivery, the OB noted that the placenta was attached to
the fibroid probably causing a component of placental
insufficiency contributing to the poor intrauterine growth.
The placenta was also anterior and was cut through during the
delivery, with presumed mild fetal blood loss.  

This infant emerged pale and mottled with diminished respiratory
effort and poor tone tone. He received positive pressure
ventilation with rapid improvement in color, tone, and
respiratory drive. Due to significant retractions and
grunting, he was transferred to the newborn intensive care
nursery on continuous positive airway pressure by bag mask.
Apgar scores were 6 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively.

ADMISSION GROWTH PARAMETERS:  Wt 2080 grams, 25%ile.  Length 46
cm, 50%ile.   HC 31.5 cm, 25%ile.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  

Respiratory: Infant developed respiratory distress syndrome, and
was initially placed on CPAP 6 cm.  He was intubated shortly
after admission due to worsening respiratory status, and was
given one dose of surfactant and placed on conventional
ventilation.  He weaned quickly, and was extubated to room air
wihtin 12 hours of life.  Mild work of breathing persisted, but
this gradually resolved over the next few days.  Of note, initial
CXR did show a small right-sided pneumothorax; this did not
require evacuation, and follow-up CXR was normal.  By time of
discharge, infant has been stable and breathing comfortably in
room air.  No apnea of prematurity was noted.  

Cardiovascular: He was given a 10 mL per kilogram bolus of
normal saline on admission for poor perfusion and metabolic
acidosis, with improvement. He was not hypotensive. He has
remained hemodynamically stable since that time without any
further cardiovascular issues.  

Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition: He was initially managed
on IV therapy of D10W with maintenance electrolytes added at
24 hours of age. He started feeds on day of life 2 with
Similac 20. He advanced to full ad-lib demand feedings by day
of life 5. At discharge, he is taking around 2-2.5 ounces
with Similac 20 with iron with good weight gain. Birth weight was
2080 grams, and weight at discharge is 2210 grams.  

GI: He received phototherapy from day of life 3 to day of
life 5 for indirect hyperbilirubinemia. His peak bilirubin
was on day of life 3, total 11.2/direct 0.3. A bilirubin off
phototherapy was total 8/0.3.

Hematology: Hematocrit on admission was 50%.  This was repeated
on day of life #2 secondary to possible blood loss at delivery,
and this was stable at 50%.  

Infectious disease: He received 48 hours of ampicillin and
gentamicin for rule out sepsis due to respiratory distress
following delivery. There were no sepsis risk factors. His CBC
was benign. Blood culture was negative.

Neurology: Neurologic exam was appropriate throughout admission. 


Sensory: Audiology: Hearing screening was performed with
automated auditory brainstem responses. He passed both ears.

Psychosocial: The family is intact. Parents have visited
daily.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:  Weight 2210 grams.  Anterior
fontanel: Open, flat, soft. Ears, eyes, nose, and throat
within normal limits. Breath sounds clear and equal with easy
work of breathing. Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
Normal pulses and perfusion. Abdomen: Soft, nondistended with
active bowel sounds. No organomegaly. No masses. Spine:
Straight, intact. Hips: Stable, no clicks or clunks. Normal
circumcised male genitalia. Testes descended bilaterally.
Skin: Intact, no lesions or rashes. Active infant with normal
tone and reflexes for gestational age.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable 2-week old infant now 37-5/7-
weeks postmenstrual age.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Discharged home with parents.

Admission Date:  [**3355-11-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**3355-11-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**3319-3-14**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Medicine/MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a critically ill
36 year old male who was transferred from the [**Hospital3 1942**]
Hospital on [**3355-11-22**] for further management of
presumed intoxication complicated by acute renal failure
requiring dialysis, pancreatitis, hepatitis and meningitis.

The patient has had a history of alcohol abuse in the past.
He was sober for approximately seven years but, during the
summer, the patient had started to abuse alcohol again.
According to his wife, he had been in detoxification four to
five times since the summer.

On [**3355-11-9**], the patient drank alcohol, amount
unknown, and then, on [**3355-11-13**], ingested
approximately two pints of vodka according to [**Hospital3 1942**]
Hospital.  The patient's wife noted that, after the
ingestion, the patient had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and
abdominal pain.

The patient then presented to [**Hospital3 1942**] Hospital on
[**3355-11-15**] and was found to be severely acidemic with
arterial blood gases of 7.01/7/100 and a potassium of
approximately 6 with a creatinine of 3.7.  According to [**Hospital3 1940**] Hospital, a toxicology screen was negative and
alcohol was negative.  The patient had low Tylenol levels.

The wife had noted that, in the past, the patient had
ingested Scope and cough syrup and had taken Tylenol P.M.,
regularly, approximately five pills at a time.  She had also
noted that a bottle of Shout was nearly empty.  The patient
was tested for ethylene glycol on [**3355-11-16**] after
hemodialysis, and was negative.  A formaldehyde antibody test
was also sent to Quest Laboratories, which is currently
pending.

At the outside hospital, the patient was emergently dialyzed
and intubated for a severe metabolic acidosis and impending
respiratory failure.  On presentation, the patient's liver
function tests were normal but began to rise to an ALT of
1,579 and AST 2,719 on [**3355-11-18**].  Sputum and stool
cultures were negative.  An abdominal ultrasound and CT scan
showed hepatomegaly.  A head CT showed sinusitis but no acute
intracranial pathology.

In total, the patient was dialyzed four times.  He was also
noted to have hypercalcemia, with a total calcium of
approximately 13.  He was given one dose of pamidronate on
[**3355-11-22**].

The patient was extubated on [**3355-11-10**].  He
apparently was speaking, recognized his wife and then became
somnolent.  He was noted to have increased agitation and was
given significant amounts of Ativan and Haldol.  He was then
transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**] [**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**] for
further management at the request of his wife.

On presentation, the patient was somnolent and unresponsive
to voice, but responded to pain.  He moved all four
extremities.  His pupils were 3 mm and unresponsive to light.
The patient also had a paradoxical breathing pattern and was
intubated for both airway protection and respiratory
distress.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Alcohol abuse.  2.  Status post
appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Vitamin K, nitroglycerin paste,
Haldol and Catapres 0.2 mg.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes one pack per day.  He is
married with an 11 year old daughter.  He works as a
mechanic.  He has a history of alcohol abuse and used cocaine
occasionally.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a brother with
hemochromatosis.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**]
[**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**], white blood cell count was 14.7, hematocrit
28.8, platelet count 288,000, prothrombin time 13.7, partial
thromboplastin time 32, INR 1.3, albumin 3.1, sodium 144,
potassium 4.1, chloride 97, bicarbonate 31, BUN 65,
creatinine 7.6 and glucose 125.  Arterial blood gases:
7.52/38/114.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 36 year old critically ill
male, intubated, with presumed ethylene glycol ingestion
complicated by meningitis, unresponsive mental status, acute
renal failure, on dialysis, hepatitis, pancreatitis and
possible aspiration/ventilator associated pneumonia.

1.  Cardiovascular/labile blood pressure:  Since the patient
presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1294**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5**] [**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7**], and at the
outside hospital, he has been largely hypertensive with a
systolic blood pressure at approximately 180 and diastolic
pressure at approximately 100.  The patient has been
intermittently on a labetalol drip.  At first, hypertension
was partly attributed to withdrawal, however, now it appears
that his hypertension may be neurologically driven.

2.  Pulmonary/intubated with possible ventilator/aspiration
pneumonia:  On [**3355-11-26**], the patient had episodes of
hypoxia and hypotension.  After suctioning, multiple mucus
plugs were seen.  The patient was planned for a bronchoscopy
but this was deferred because his hypoxia had resolved.  A
chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates
consistent with possible aspiration pneumonia.  The patient
is currently on vancomycin, levofloxacin and ampicillin.

3.  Renal/anuric, acute renal failure:  This was thought
secondary to toxic ingestion.  The patient is currently on
hemodialysis.  During his hospitalization, the patient has
had significant hyperkalemia with a potassium of 7.4 and
peaked T waves on electrocardiogram.  On admission, the
patient was noted to have red blood cell casts in his urine.
A glomerulonephritis workup is in progress but has been
largely negative thus far.  The patient's BUN remains high
and it is unclear at this point whether uremia is
contributing to the patient's declining mental status.

4.  Infectious disease/meningitis and increasing white blood
cell count:  Due to the patient's poor mental status, a
lumbar puncture was done which showed 95 white blood cells, 3
red blood cells with a differential of 68% polycytes, 7%
lymphocytes and 27% monocytes.  The second tube showed 49
white blood cells and 136 red blood cells with 63% polycytes,
2% bands, 17% lymphocytes and 18% monocytes.  Gram stain and
culture have been negative thus far.  Protein was 428,
glucose 108.

The Infectious Disease Service has been consulted and is
following the patient closely.  The patient is currently on
intravenous levofloxacin 250 mg every other day, ampicillin
and vancomycin to cover for Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, drug resistant Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Listeria, atypical bacteria and Yersinia.  There
is a question of whether the family history of
hemochromatosis may invoke Listeria, Yersinia, Vibrio and
fungal cryptococci.  The suspicion of hemachromatosis in the
patient is low, with an iron of 26, low TIBC but ferritin of
greater than 1,000.

On [**3355-11-25**], a left subclavian catheter was positive
for Methicillin sensitive coagulase negative Staphylococcus.
The patient also had one peripheral blood culture with the
same sensitivities.

5.  Gastrointestinal/hepatitis and pancreatitis:  The
patient's hepatitis has been improving, however, his lipase
continues to rise.  The patient was continued on supportive
care for pancreatitis.

6.  Genitourinary:  The patient has a Foley.

7.  Hematology:  The patient remains anemic but has no clear
source of bleeding.  The patient has been transfused two
units of packed red blood cells on [**3355-11-25**].

8.  Neurology/unresponsive and comatose:  The patient's
mental status continues to decline.  Upon presentation, he
had reflexes and was moving all extremities.  Currently, the
patient does not have any spontaneous movement and pupils
remain unreactive.  Neurology was consulted.  The meningitis
is most likely a chemical meningitis but the patient is being
empirically treated with antibiotics.

The patient had an apnea test.  Respiratory efforts were
thought to be seen but it was unclear.  The patient had an
electroencephalogram and a repeat lumbar puncture planned for
the future.

9.  Toxicology/presumed ethylene glycol ingestion:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was consulted and believed that this presentation is
consistent with ethylene glycol ingestion, however, no
crystals were seen on cerebrospinal fluid or urine samples.

10. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient is on
total parenteral nutrition.

11. Prophylaxis:  The patient was on Protonix and Venodynes.

12. Code status:  The patient was full code until [**3355-11-29**], when the family decided to make the patient comfort
measures only.

On [**3355-11-29**], the patient's wife, daughter and other
members of the patient's family approached the medical team,
including Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 940**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1152**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and nurse,
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 9321**], and expressed their wish to withdraw ventilatory
support from Mr. [**Known patient lastname 9322**].  This decision was made after
considering the patient's wishes regarding a state of grave
clinical prognosis.  A priest was called to administer Last
Rites.  Many members of the family were present in the room.

The patient was extubated at 12:10 on [**3355-11-29**] and
the family gathered around him.  The patient became asystolic
at 12:17 and was pronounced at 12:32.  The patient did not
demonstrate any signs of discomfort.  The medical examiner
was called because there was suspicion of acute ingestion of
a poison in this case.  The medical examiner accepted the
case under her jurisdiction and stated plans to pick up the
body.  [**Doctor First Name **] [**Known patient lastname 9322**], the patient's wife, was called
informing her of this situation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to possible ethylene glycol
ingestion.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Deceased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known patient lastname 9346**] was admitted under the Urology service for her 
procedure. She was prepared and consented as per standard.
.
She was taken to the OR. During the surgery, there were some 
episodes of hypotension. She received neosynephrine 
intermittently during the case. Midway during the case, during 
the vaginal ressection, she was noted to have 1.2 L blood loss. 
She received 3 units of PRBCs. Immediately post transfusion her 
hct was noted to be 43. She had no cardiovascular events or 
other significant events. In the recovery room, her blood 
pressure was slightly low and this was addressed. She was 
transfered to the ICU soon after. In the ICU, the Pt had a hard 
to measure and read BP; a-line attempted in radial, brachial, 
and femoral positions.  On transfer to the FICU, her noninvasive 
BP readings were 170-190 mmhg, which was confired after 
placement of an a-line by the surgical service. She was on an 
epidural dilaudid infusion during the OR, and this was stopped 
post op given her labile BP. She was give 2 L LR on transfer to 
the FICU. For pain control, she was given a totoal of 125 mcg 
fentanyl over 1.5 hrs while she was being settled.  
.  
Initally in the FICU she was hypertensive, with the working 
diagnosis related to pain and anxiety. In addition, she was on 
lopressor and clonidine outpt and there was some thought she 
might be having a tachyphylaxisis response. She had a few beats 
on NSVT, one run on 9-10 beats with BP in the 80's. She denied 
any chest pain or pressure at that time. LR 250 cc given with 
improvment in her BP. K was normal but Mg noted to be 1.4, which 
was repleted. IV lopressor 2.5 mg given for periop protection 
and for the NSVT. Her EKG was unchanged from her preop. Cardiac 
enzymes were sent.  
.  
A CVL was placed in the left subclavian. Initially, the line was 
too deep; this was pulled back and another CXR confirmed the 
position. 
.  
Repeat Hcts showed 40 and then 35.3. With transient low BP's to 
the mid 70's and high 80's there was concern for bleeding. CVP 
was measured at 0. Pt given IVF, another hct was sent. Surgery 
notified for concern of bleeding. Two unit of PRBCs were given 
for hct 32 and BP in the low 80's.  
.
Ms [**Known patient lastname 9346**] continued to improve in the ICU and was closely 
monitored. The following morning, she was given another 2 units 
of packed red blood cells. Her hematocrit then went up to 33.5. 
From this point on, she was stablized and her vitals continued 
to improve. However, there were some blood pressure 
difficulties, as she was initially hypotensive, but soon after, 
became hypertensive. 
.
In the following few days, Ms [**Known patient lastname 9346**] made a gradual recovery. 
She was able to be sent to the floor, where she was put back on 
her home medications. Despite her antihypertensive home 
medications, her overnight blood pressure was not 
well-controlled. She was given IV hydralazine for a systolic BP 
greater than 160 overnight. 
.
On the floor, Ms [**Known patient lastname 9346**] was able to pass gas and hence advance 
her diet. However, she had a great deal of nausea, vomiting and 
was generally not feeling well. Her vomit did not contain any 
blood. Her abdomen was slightly distended, and hence, it was 
decided to obtain a C. Diff stool culture. This came back as 
positive, and hence, Ms [**Known patient lastname 9346**] was started on a 14-day course of 
Flagyl, which she will continue at home for another 9 days after 
discharge. Initially, her bowel movements remained loose, and 
frequent (4-5 times per day) and her nausea and vomiting 
persisted. It was suspected that she was vomiting the 
antibiotic, but before switching to an oral antibiotic, she 
slowly began to tolerate her oral medication. SHe then slowly 
began to increase her oral food intake, starting with soup and 
eventually progressing to toast and then a full dinner.
.
Ms [**Known patient lastname 9346**] was discharged with her staples removed and in a 
stable condition.

Admission Date: [**3095-5-3**]        Discharge Date: 5 /20/2005

Date of Birth:  [**3095-5-3**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NB


HISTORY:  Jacouri [**Known patient lastname 11909**] was admitted to the newborn ICU due
to early jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia of 16.7 at
approximately 15 hours of age. Mother is a 25 year old G10 P1
now 2 mother with an EDC of [**3095-6-1**]. Prenatal labs were
blood type A positive, antibody screen negative, RPR
nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, sickle cell negative, VZV immune, GBS negative.
Repeat RPR negative in [**3095-2-12**].

On [**3095-4-25**], maternal liver function tests were elevated,
with an ALT of 145, AST 83, total bilirubin of 0.8. Uric acid
was 3.7, platelets 370,000, and blood pressures with
diastolics in the 70-80s the week of [**4-25**].
Evaluation for pregnancy induced hypertension was negative at
that time. Her liver enzymes remained elevated on [**4-29**], and
she underwent an hepatic ultrasound at that time that was
reported to have normal hepatic vasculature. She also had a
24 hour urine sent for copper to rule out [**Location (un) 811**] disease. Due
to the elevated liver enzymes, mother was induced and
delivered on [**3095-5-2**]. Spontaneous rupture of membranes
with meconium. Male infant was born on [**3095-5-3**] at 4:40
p.m. by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Apgars were 8 and 9. He
was noted on day of life 1 to be jaundiced in the newborn
nursery, and had a bilirubin sent that was 16.7 at 15 hours
of age. He was transferred to the NICU for evaluation and
management of early hyperbilirubinemia.

ADMISSION EXAMINATION:  Temperature 36, heart rate 126,
respiratory rate 40-50's, blood pressure 69/43. Oxygen
saturation 100 percent on room air. Birth weight 2.62 kg. In
general, infant who appeared jaundiced, in no acute distress,
not dysmorphic, appropriate for gestational age of 35 weeks.
HEENT within normal limits from external exam. Neck within
normal limits. Chest clear and equal bilaterally.
Cardiovascular - Normal S1 and S2. Soft grade I murmur heard
best along the left sternal border. Precordium within normal
limits. Peripheral pulses normal in all extremities.
Perfusion normal. Abdomen - No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
Bowel sounds are present. Soft, nontender. No masses.
Genitourinary - Within normal limits. Male with normal
scrotum. Anus patent, trace meconium. Back within normal
limits. Extremities normal. Neurologic appropriate for
newborn in terms of reflexes, alertness, posture, tone
strength, sucking, crying and movements. Skin jaundiced.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. RESPIRATORY. He has been stable on room air throughout his
   stay in the NICU.
2. CARDIOVASCULAR. He has been cardiovascularly stable, with
   normal blood pressures and perfusion. He has had a soft,
   intermittent murmur heard in the first 3 days of life, but
   this has not persisted.
3. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION. He was originally on
   intravenous fluids, but has been p.o. feeding ad lib on
   top of this from birth. He is currently taking Enfamil 20
   cal/oz ad lib, and on day of this dictation, he weighs
   2.62 kg, which is exactly his birth weight. He had normal
   electrolytes and glucoses throughout his stay.
4. HEMATOLOGY. His initial admission hematocrit was 33%, with
   a reticulocyte count of 19.8 percent. His white blood cell
   count at that time was 16.9, with platelets 55,000.
   Differential had 60 percent neutrophils, no bands. He had
   direct antibody testing sent at that time, and it was
   negative. It was also repeated on day of life 3 and found
   to be negative as well. His blood type is A positive. As
   stated, Coombs testing was negative. His admission
   bilirubin was 16.7. He was placed under phototherapy. His
   bilirubin peaked on day of life 1 at 17.5, with a direct
   component of 0.6. Over the next 2 days of his life, his
   bilirubin decreased. On day of life 2, it was 13.1. He had
   stabilized, and over the next 4 days ranged between 10 -
   14. The day prior to his discharge, his bilirubin was 8.2.
   His phototherapy was discontinued when his bilirubin was
   8.2, and plan was to check at least 2 rebound bilirubins
   prior to his discharge. Most recent bilirubin done as a
outpatient on [**3095-5-13**] was 4.7/0.3. This was down from 7.3/0.3
on the day of discharge. 

   Hematology was consulted
   during his stay, and additional testing was done to work
   up his hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia.
   Quantitative G6PD screening was sent and was found to be
   low at 5.7. In the presence of reticulocytosis, this is
   likely indicative of G6PD deficiency. At the time of
   dictation, he also has sent out labs for hemoglobin
   sequencing and red blood cell quantification, pending. He
   had a [**Doctor Last Name 3832**] body prep test that was negative during his
   stay. His hematocrit continued to decrease over the first
   few days of his life, with a nadir of 24.2 percent on day
   of life 5. He was therefore transfused 20 cc/kg total,
   over a total of 12 hours, and his post transfusion
   hematocrit came up to 41 percent on day of life 6. During
   the first day of his life, because of hyperbilirubinemia
   of unclear etiology, he was transfused with 1 dose of
   intravenous IG.
5. GASTROINTESTINAL. On day of life 2, he had liver enzymes
   sent in the face of hemolysis. These were found to be
   normal.
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. He had a urine sent for CMV that has
   been negative. This was sent on initial workup to rule out
   any infectious causes that could affect his liver and
   therefore lead to the hyperbilirubinemia. He was never
   placed on antibiotics due to the lack of sepsis risk
   factors and normal exam and laboratory studies upon
   admission to the NICU.
7. AUDIOLOGY. Hearing screening was performed and was normal
prior to
   his discharge. He received his hepatitis B vaccination.

Date of Birth:   [**2805-3-9**]       Sex:  M

Service:  D FIRM TRANSFERRED TO CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
male, with past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, status post three-vessel CABG, history of MI,
and type 2 diabetes, who presented to an outside hospital
with bright red blood per rectum, and transferred to [**Hospital1 83**]
for colonoscopy and further GI work-up.

The patient originally presented to [**Hospital3 3087**] on
[**9-24**], complaining of bright red blood per rectum, and
abdominal pain.  The patient was hemodynamically stable upon
admission with an hematocrit of 34.  He initially had an NG
lavage which was negative for any active bleeding.  The
patient was closely monitored with serial hematocrits.  He
had additional episodes of GI bleeding on [**9-27**] and
[**9-28**].  His crit dropped from 34 to 30.  He received
multiple blood transfusions with a total of 6 units of blood
transfused.  With these episodes of bleeding, the patient
remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic except for some
epigastric pressure attributed to dyspepsia.  Evaluation for
cardiac ischemia was negative. The patient was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 83**] on [**9-29**] for further GI work-up and planned
colonoscopy.  At time of arrival to [**Hospital1 83**], the patient denied any
active complaints.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for GI bleeding, as above.  He
denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal
pain, dizziness, or other complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease, three-vessel CABG in [**2870**],
myocardial infarction in [**2869**] and 1984.
2. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3. History of GI bleed in [**2882**] due to diverticulosis.
4. Appendectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History of tobacco abuse, quit in [**2869**].
Occasional alcohol use, approximately 1 drink per month.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM - VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.2,
blood pressure 109/58, pulse 69, respirations 18, O2 sat 97%
on room air.
GENERAL:  Patient lying in bed in no acute distress.
SKIN:  Pale.  No diaphoresis.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx
clear.
NECK:  Supple, no LAD.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and equal bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, distended, positive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Trace pitting edema bilaterally.

LABS AT ADMISSION:  White count 16.6, hematocrit 31.2,
platelets 232, sodium 142, K 3.7, chloride 105, bicarb 24,
BUN 19, creatinine 0.9, glucose 134.

INITIAL EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, with a rate of 68, first
degree AV conduction delay, no ST segment changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE -
1) GI:  The patient was transferred from outside hospital with
bright red blood per rectum.  He had an NG lavage at the
outside hospital which was negative for any active bleeding.
Because of the repeated episodes of bleeding, GI elected to
perform a colonoscopy to assess if any intervention might be
possible to reduce risk of further bleeding.  This was performed
on [**9-29**] and showed diverticulosis but no active bleeding.
Because of his cardiovascular staus, the patient received no
sedation, and he tolerated the procedure well.  It was presumed
that he had bled from a diverticulum, and he had no further
episodes of rectal bleeding following his arrival at [**Hospital1 83**].
During the hospitalization, he received a total of 2 units of
blood to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30.

2) CARDIOVASCULAR - A) ISCHEMIA:  At the time of admission, the
patient had complaints of mild indigestion which were concerning
for possible angina.  He was initially ruled out for MI on
[**9-28**] with serial enzymes and EKG's.  The patient then
developed an episode of increased chest pain on the morning of
[**9-29**].  His EKG showed ST depression in leads V3 through V6,
consistent with a possible strain pattern.  Cardiac enzymes were
cycled with his initial set of enzymes negative. The patient
ruled-in with second set of enzymes with a peak CK of 2,822, with
an MB of 312, and a troponin of 4.4.  The patient was diagnosed
with a non-ST elevation MI in a setting of a GI bleed and
coronary artery disease.  Initially, he was managed medically
and transfused to maintain hematocrits greater than 30.
Cardiology was consulted to see the patient.

B) ARRHYTHMIA:  On the day following admission, [**9-29**], the
patient had a V-fib arrest at approximately 4:30 pm.  The
patient was found by physician to be pulseless.  A code was
called and CPR was initiated.  The patient's initial rhythm
was V-fib.  He received 3 shocks.  He then went into a PEA
rhythm and received both atropine and epinephrine.  The
patient also was given bicarb, along with IV fluids.  The
patient then converted into a rhythm of SVT with a rate of
150 and systolic blood pressure of 80.  His rhythm was
thought to be atrial fibrillation. The cardiologists concluded
the arrest was likely due to ischemia and that an emergent
cardiac catheterization with possible intervention would offer
the greatest chance of survival, and the family consented to the
procedure. He went to emergent cardiac catheterization which did
show two of his grafts were completely occluded, and he had a 90%
lesion in his SVG-OM graft which collateralized his LAD and RCA.
His SVG-OM graft was stented with an Express stent.  Stenting was
complicated by perforation which was quickly corrected without
any adverse consequences.  The patient was initially placed on
Integrilin drip.  However, this was held following his
perforation.  He was also started on aspirin and Plavix,
which were continued postcatheterization.  He was also
continued on a statin.  Beta blocker was held in the setting
of cardiogenic shock.  Following catheterization, the patient was
monitored closely on telemetry in the CCU.  He had no further
episodes of V-fib or V- tach.


C) PUMP:  After the arrest, the patient remained in severe
cardiogenic shock.  He was started on a dopamine drip, and
subsequently Levophed was added.  During the emergent cardiac
catheterization, an intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed for cardiogenic shock.  He was also continued on
Levophed and dopamine drips for pressure support.  Following
catheterization, the patient was slowly weaned off his
Levophed drip, and then off the dopamine drip.  The patient
had an elevated wedge pressure.  A Nipride drip was started
for afterload reduction, and he was slowly converted over to
po captopril and weaned off his Nipride drip.  The patient
was maintained on the intra-aortic balloon pump at a rate of
1:1.  His blood pressure did not tolerate any weaning off of
the balloon pump.

On [**10-2**], the patient had several hypotensive episodes.
He was restarted on the dopamine drip.  His hypotension was
thought to be a combination of cardiogenic shock, neurological
decompensation, and administration of sedating and vasodilatory
medications.

3) NEUROLOGIC:  The patient initially had no neurological
issues at time of admission.  Following his V-fib arrest, the
patient was unresponsive with a neurological exam concerning
for anoxic brain injury.  A CT of the head showed no gross
hemorrhage or edema.  It was significant only for old lacunar
infarcts in the basal ganglia.

Neurology was consulted for further evaluation.  An EEG was
obtained which showed epileptiform activity.  It also showed
moderate to moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy
consistent with anoxic brain injury.  The patient was thought
to be in status epilepticus and was initially loaded with
both ativan and Dilantin.  He had a slight decrease in his
epileptiform activity with this regimen.  Subsequently,
valproic acid was added.  The patient continued to have
seizure activity and was also started on phenobarbital.  The
patient did have cessation of his status epilepticus on this
multiple antiepileptic medication regimen.  A repeat EEG was
suggestive of severe generalized cerebral injury.

Given the patient's significant hypoxic brain injury
following prolonged V-fib arrest, in conjunction with his
status epilepticus and EEG findings, the patient's prognosis
was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient's severe
ischemic brain injury and extremely poor prognosis were
conveyed to the patient's family.  It was thought that the
patient had no meaningful chance of recovery, and based on
patient's previously expressed wishes, it was thought that he
would not desire continued supportive care, given his
neurologic injuries.

4) PULMONARY:  The patient was intubated at the time of his
V-fib arrest.  He was continued on the ventilator following
his transfer to the CCU.  He was briefly tried on pressure
support, but became apneic, and was then maintained on assist
control ventilation.

5) ID:  The patient initially had no ID issues upon
admission.  Following his V-fib arrest and transfer to the
unit, he did have significant leukocytosis.  This was thought
to be likely a stress response in conjunction with his
hypoxia.  The day following intubation, the patient began to
have increased secretions and was thought to have a likely
aspiration pneumonia.  His sputum culture showed rare
gram-negative rods and moderate growth of Staph aureus.  He
was started on Zosyn for antibiotic coverage for a presumed
aspiration pneumonia.  Blood cultures were also obtained
which showed no evidence of bacteremia.

6) FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient initially
kept NPO in preparation for colonoscopy, given his GI
bleeding.  He was then started on a cardiac "Heart Healthy
Diet."  His electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed
throughout the hospitalization.  The patient had significant
lactic acidosis following his V-fib arrest thought to be due
to his hypoxia.  His lactate was followed and trended down
without any further intervention.  He did receive bicarbonate
at the time of the code.  His electrolytes continued to be
followed closely while in the CCU.

7) ENDOCRINE:  The patient admitted with a history of type 2
diabetes and was initially placed on Glucophage per his home
regimen.  Following his admission to the unit, his Glucophage
was held, and he was instead placed on an Insulin drip.
However, his blood sugars remained normal, and the Insulin
drip was discontinued.  He maintained normoglycemia without
any active intervention.

8) PROPHYLAXIS:  He was placed on a proton pump inhibitor
for GI prophylaxis, given his GI bleed and his placement on
the ventilator.  He was also on a heparin drip for DVT
prophylaxis, given his intra-aortic balloon pump.

DISPOSITION:  Following patient's V-fib arrest with anoxic
brain injury, he remained unresponsive.  He was evaluated by
neurology.  Given his extremely poor prognosis, and patient's
wishes were discussed with the family, it was thought that
the patient would not wish to have continued supportive care,
given his current medical condition.  The patient's code
status was then changed to comfort measures only.  He was
started on a morphine drip, and his medications were
withdrawn, and the patient was extubated.  The patient
continued to be unresponsive, and his blood pressure and
heart rate trended down, and he became apneic.  The patient
then expired at 7:55 pm.  His family was notified of his
status.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Lower gastrointestinal bleed secondary to diverticulosis.
2. Anemia.
3. Ventricular fibrillation arrest.
4. Coronary artery disease, status post cardiac
catheterization with stenting of saphenous vein graft-obtuse
marginal graft.
5. Anoxic brain injury.
6. Status epilepticus.
7. Cardiogenic shock.
8. Respiratory failure.
9. Aspiration pneumonia.
10.Lactic acidosis.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient deceased.

Service:  CSU


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 13506**] is a 56-year-old
man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,  current
smoking, who presented to primary care provider's office with
two weeks of exertional chest burning, relieved with rest.
He thought he was having reflux given his history of GERD,
but does note that it felt somewhat different and this is why
he sought care.  The patient denies shortness of breath,
chest pain, and has no cardiac history.  At the primary care
provider's office he was noted to have EKG changes from his
baseline, most notably diffuse anterior T-wave inversions,
and was referred to [**Hospital1 **]-MC Emergency Room.
The patient had a cath on arrival, given his concerning EKG
changes.  Cath showed a left dominant system with three
vessel disease including an LAD 40 percent proximal lesion
and 90 percent mid lesion, totally occluded after D2, left
circumflex with 40 percent proximal, OM1 small with a 90
percent stenosis,  PDA with 90 percent stenosis, and RCA that
was totally occluded proximally with left to right
collaterals, and an EF of 60 percent.  CT surgery was
consulted to evaluate for possible surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypothyroidism, renal
cysts, chronic renal insufficiency, nephrolithiasis, status
post lithotripsy and cholelithiasis.  The patient also states
a history of hypertension.

He has an allergy to sulfa.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Altace 10 every day, aspirin 325 every
day, and Indapamine 2.5 every day and Zyrtec.

The patient's vital signs following catheterization showed
temperature 97.4, heart rate 78, blood pressure 150/70,
respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 100 percent on room air.
Physical exam showed alert and oriented Russian speaking
male.  HEENT showed pupils equally round, reactive to light,
extraocular movements intact.  Neck was supple, no JVD.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
showed regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with
no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Pulses 2 plus bilaterally
throughout the lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.3, hematocrit 41.7, platelets
120,000, sodium 138, potassium 3.7, chloride 98, CO2 29, BUN
17, creatinine 1.4.  EKG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 70
with a PR of 0.24, left atrial enlargement, borderline left
axis with diffuse anterior T-wave inversions.

The patient was admitted to the cardiology service and was
seen by cardiac surgery,  however, he initially refused to
consent to surgery and after three days the patient finally
consented to surgery.  On [**3100-10-19**] the patient was brought to
the Operating Room.  Please see the OR report for full
details.  In summary he had a CABG times four with a LIMA to
the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the distal LAD,
saphenous vein graft to OM and saphenous vein graft to the
PDA.  His bypass time was 66 minutes with a cross clamp time
of 54 minutes.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer the patient was A-paced at 80 beats
per minute with a mean arterial pressure of 74 and a CVP of
80.  He had Neo-Synephrine at 0.3 mcg per kilogram per minute
and propofol 20 mcg per kilogram per minute.  The patient did
well in the immediate postoperative period.  His anesthesia
was reversed.  He was weaned from the ventilator and
successfully extubated.  The patient was noted on day of
surgery to have ST elevations on the monitor and he was begun
on a nitroglycerin drip following transfer to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day one the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  His IV nitroglycerin was transitioned to oral
nitrates.  He was begun on Beta blockade as well as
diuretics, however, he remained in the ICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.

On postoperative day two his chest tubes were removed as well
as his central venous access, and he was transferred to
______ for continuing postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.  Over the next two days the patient had an
uneventful postoperative course.  His activity level was
increased with the assistance of the nursing staff and
physical therapy once he arrived on the floor.

On postoperative day four it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged to home.

At the time of this dictation the patient's physical exam was
as follows:  Vital signs showed temperature 98.7, heart rate
74 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 108/47, respiratory rate 20,
O2 saturation 95 percent on room air.  Weight preoperatively
86 kg, at discharge 89.3 kg.  Physical exam in general showed
no acute distress.  Neurologically alert, responsive, Russian
speaking.  Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac  regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  Sternum was
stable.  Incision with staples without erythema or drainage.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities warm, well perfused with no edema.
Left saphenous vein graft harvest site with Steri Strips,
open to air, clean and dry.

Patient's condition at time of discharge is good.  He is to
be discharged home with visiting nurses.

ADDENDUM TO DISCHARGE SUMMARY DATED [**3346-10-12**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
2.  Neurological - The patient was without a pulse for ten to
fifteen minutes prior to coming into the hospital.  He
presented with unresponsiveness with only posturing to
painful stimuli.  On hospital day number two after his
catheterization, his mental status much improved with
reactive pupils and eye tracking.  He gradually regained
consciousness but initially was confused with garbled speech.
He continued to be disoriented.  Neurology was consulted to
evaluate whether his mental status change is due to a
reversible encephalopathy or whether it was due to anoxic
encephalopathy from no CPR prior to coming into the hospital.

Head CT was performed which showed no definite acute
intracranial hemorrhage and a small area of hyperdensity in
the right region that could be artifact.  Blood cultures,
urine cultures were taken which were negative for infection.
Vitamin B12 and folate and TSH were checked, which were all
within normal limits.  Repeat head CT was performed to
further evaluate whether the initial CT contained artifact or
whether it was a possible hemorrhage.  The second CT revealed
a right temporal lesion consistent with hemorrhagic
contusion, however, it was difficult to assess whether this
contusion was causing his change in mental status or whether
these symptoms can be explained to anoxic encephalopathy.

It was felt that based on his confusional state, however,
that this is most likely anoxic encephalopathy, especially to
the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.  His mental status
remained disoriented, only oriented to self, and his gait
slightly improved requiring no assistance with ambulation.

He is to follow-up with neurology to evaluate for improvement
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately three to
four weeks.

3.  Hematology - The patient was started on Aspirin, Plavix,
Heparin and Integrilin after his cardiac catheterization.
His platelets acutely dropped after administration of Heparin
and Integrilin.  Integrilin was discontinued.  Heparin
antibodies were sent which were negative.  Given his low
ejection fraction, it was determined to start him on Coumadin
for anticoagulation for prophylaxis of embolization.
However, given the recent read of head CT with possible
intracranial hemorrhage, his Heparin and Coumadin were
discontinued.  Plavix will be continued for thirty days and
he will continue on Aspirin.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital6 4419**] for
monitoring of his mental status and more assistance in
activities of daily living and physical therapy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily for thirty days.
3.  Pravachol 20 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day p.r.n.
5.  Thiamine 100 mg p.o. once daily.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year-old gentleman
with a history of a large anterior wall myocardial infarction
in [**3143-7-17**] who has been experiencing shortness of breath
and substernal chest tightness over the last month.  An
echocardiogram performed on [**10-19**] revealed an ejection
fraction of 20 to 25% with severe hypokinesis of the
anterolateral walls, trace aortic regurgitation and 1+ mitral
regurgitation.  The patient was referred for cardiac
catheterization on [**11-9**], which showed an ejection
fraction of 35%, a 30% left main osteal lesion, 90% mid
vessel left anterior descending coronary artery lesion
involving a large diagonal, a 60% osteal circumflex lesion
and a 50% osteal right coronary artery lesion.  The patient
was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1142**] for coronary artery bypass
grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Status post myocardial infarction 1996 with a history of
a stent to left anterior descending coronary artery.
3.  History of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
4.  Status post left hip replacement in [**3149**].
5.  Status post back surgery in [**3137**].
6.  Status post bilateral cataract surgery in [**3150**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife.  He
has a ten pack year smoking history, but he quit twenty years
ago and has one to two alcoholic drinks per week.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 392**] on [**11-15**] for a coronary artery
bypass graft times two off pump with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1142**].  The
patient had left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, and saphenous vein graft
to D1.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition.  Please see operative note for
further details.  The patient was extubated from mechanical
ventilation on the evening of postoperative day zero.  The
patient required neo-synephrine and fusion into postoperative
day number one to maintain blood pressure.  The patient had
excellent hemodynamic parameters with cardiac index greater
then 3.  The patient's pulmonary artery catheter was removed
on postoperative day number one.  The neo-synephrine was
weaned to off.  On postoperative day number two the patient
went into atrial fibrillation with variable ventricular
response.  The patient was bolused and restarted on
Amiodarone.  The Electrophisiology Service was consulted.
The patient was preoperatively recommended to have an ICD
implanted due to his low ejection fraction.  The patient was
started on heparin for anticoagulation for his atrial
fibrillation and had been started on Plavix per the off pump
coronary artery bypass graft protocol.

On postoperative day number three the patient experienced
some mild confusion and was given some low dose Haldol,
subsequently confusion resolved.  Postoperative day three the
patient was ambulating with physical therapy and had an
episode of orthostasis.  His Lasix was discontinued at this
time as the patient was below his preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the
regular floor on postoperative day number five.  The patient
was beginning to ambulate with physical therapy.  On the
evening of postoperative day number five the patient
converted from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.  On
postoperative day number six the patient was taken to the
Electrophisiology Laboratory for implantation of his AICD.
He tolerated this procedure well and was transferred back to
the floor in stable condition.  Chest x-ray the following day
showed no effusion and no pneumothorax.  Testing of the
device the following day showed that it was functioning
adequately.  On postoperative day number seven after the
patient had been on bed rest for 24 hours for his
implantation of his AICD the patient attempted ambulation
with physical therapy.  At that time the patient was noted to
be significantly orthostatic and was not able to ambulate.
No intervention was taken, however, when the patient stood up
a few hours later he was not orthostatic.

On postoperative day number eight the patient was able to
ambulate with physical therapy at about 200 feet without
problems.  On postoperative day number nine the patient was
able to complete a level five with physical therapy, which is
walking 500 feet and climbing one flight of stairs without
any difficulty without requiring oxygen and while remaining
hemodynamically stable.  The patient's INR on Coumadin had
risen to 1.5.  It was decided that the patient could be
cleared for discharge to home with Lovenox therapy until his
INR became therapeutic.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature max 98.6.  Pulse 80.  A
paced, blood pressure 102/60.  Respiratory rate 16.  Room air

fetal movement.  There was some vaginal bleeding.
Biophysical profile was 8 out of 8.  She was treated with
magnesium sulfate and betamethasone.  The decision was made
to proceed to cesarean section due to concern for possible
placenta abruption.  The infant emerged with spontaneous cry,
cyanosis.  Apgars were 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes.
He was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for
treatment of prematurity and respiratory distress.

HOSPITAL COURSE/LABORATORY DATA:

1.  Respiratory:  [**Known patient lastname 747**] required intubation and mechanical
ventilation for his respiratory distress.  He received one dose
of Surfactant. His maximum ventilatory settings were 20 peak
inspiratory pressure over 5 positive and expiratory pressure.
Intermittent mandatory ventilatory rate of 18.  He was
extubated to continue his positive airway pressure on day of
life number one.  He continued on the continuous positive
airway pressure for an additional 48 hours and on day of life
three was moved to room air.  He had apnea of prematurity
that required treatment with caffeine.  The caffeine was
initially discontinued on day of life number eighteen, but he
had reoccurrence of the frequency of his apneic episodes and
the caffeine was restarted on [**3347-7-17**].  The caffeine was
again discontinued on [**3347-7-24**] and [**Known patient lastname 747**] has had no
further episodes of apnea since that time.  At the time of
discharge his respirations are easy in the 40s to 50s.

2.  Cardiovascular:  [**Known patient lastname 747**] has maintained normal heart
rates and blood pressures during admission.  A murmur was
noted on day of life number 26 and felt to be consistent with
peripheral pulmonic stenosis and electrocardiogram was within
normal limits.  Blood pressures were also within normal
limits.  On chest x-ray his heart had a normal size and
silhouette.  Further cardiologic evaluation is deferred to
the primary pediatrician.  The murmur remains present at
discharge.  Mother is aware.  

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known patient lastname 747**] was
initially NPO and maintained on intravenous fluids.  Enteral
feedings were started on day of life number two and gradually
advanced to full volume.  His maximum caloric intake was
fortified breast milk to 26 calories per ounce with additional
protein supplement ProMod.  At the time of discharge he is
taking expressed mother's milk fortified by 4 calories per ounce
to 24 calories with Enfamil powder.  His weight on the day of
discharge is 2.86 kilograms with a length of 48.5 cm and a
head circumference of 33 cm.  Serum electrolytes were checked
three times during admission and were all within normal
limits.

4.  Infectious disease:  Due to his respiratory distress and
prematurity, [**Known patient lastname 747**] was evaluated for sepsis at the time of
admission.  A white blood cell count was 13,400 with a
differential of 44% polys, 0% bands, blood culture was
obtained prior to initiating intravenous Ampicillin and
Gentamycin.  The blood culture was no growth at 48 hours and
the antibiotics were discontinued.  There were no other
infectious disease issues during admission.

5.  Hematological:  [**Known patient lastname 749**] hematocrit at birth was 50%.  A
repeat hematocrit was sent on [**3347-7-16**] and was 28.6% with a
reticulocyte count of 4.4%.  [**Known patient lastname 747**] was treated and is being
discharged on supplemental iron and polyvisol.  He did not
receive any transfusions or blood products during admission.

6.  Gastrointestinal:  [**Known patient lastname 747**] required treatment for
unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.  His peak
serum bilirubin occurred on day of life number four with a
total of 10.9 mg per deciliter over 0.3 mg per deciliter
direct.  He was treated with phototherapy for approximately
72 hours.  His rebound bilirubin on [**3347-7-28**] was 5.6, total
over 0.5 direct.

7.  Neurological:  [**Known patient lastname 747**] had a normal head ultrasound on
[**3347-6-29**].  There were no neurological concerns at the time
of discharge.

8.  Sensory:  Hearing screening was performed with automated
auditory brain stem responses.  [**Known patient lastname 747**] passed in both ears.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with parents.  The primary
pediatrician is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 453**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 750**], Pediatrics at [**Hospital3 751**] [**State 590**], [**Location (un) 83**], [**State 752**].  Phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 753**].

Addendum:
On [**3259-11-27**] liver biopsy done for elevated LFTs. Developed 
hypotension and tachycardia that was treated with IV bolus. Hct 
stable at 33.3. Psychiatry was consulted for evaluation of 
risperdal as possible cause of hypotension. Risperdal was 
discontinued and seroquel started without much change in 
hypotension and tachycardia. 
[**3259-11-28**] patient c/o SOB with O2sat of 86% RA. O2sat increased to 
99% with 3L nasal cannula O2. Remained in sinus tachycardia with 
rates in 110-120s. Urine sent for culture. [**11-29**] urine cx grew E. 
coli and IV zosyn was started. This was switched to primaxin for 
seven days.  
[**3259-12-2**] Due to poor po intake, a post pyloric feeding tube was 
placed and respalor continuous tube feedings were started with 
goal of 45ml/hour. 
[**3259-12-3**] Cardiology was consulted for persistent sinus 
tachycardia and hypotension. After IV fluid challenge without 
resolution of tachycardia, lower extremity u/s were obtained 
with small R peroneal thrombus noted. On [**3259-12-4**] chest CTA 
revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli with large right 
pleural effusion and right opacities suggestive of infectious 
process. Heparin drip and coumadin were initiated with inr goal 
of 2.5-3.0. Heparin was stopped when goal reached. Currently on 
Coumadin 1mg po qd with INR 2.7 on [**3259-12-11**]. 
Currently, [**Known patient firstname **] has poor activity tolerance requiring transfer 
to rehab with monitoring of INR biweekly for goal of 2.5-3.0. 
She will require biweekly lab monitoring on Mondays and 
Thursdays of cbc, lfts with albumin,PT, PTT, INR, chem 10 and 
cyclosporin level. The cyclosporin level will need to be drawn 2

ADDENDUM:  The patient remained well from a cardiovascular
point of view throughout his stay in the hospital, however,
he did remain confused.  The patient was oriented to self.
He was not oriented to date or place.  He had no focal
neurological deficits on neurological examination.
Computerized tomography scan of the head was obtained which
was negative for bleed or stroke.  After further research it
was revealed that the patient had not tolerated beta blockers
in the past, as they made him depressed and lethargic.  It
was felt that the beta blockers may be contributing to his
confusion now.  Therefore, the patient's beta blocker was
tapered.  It is yet to be seen if this helps clear his mental
status.  If it does not, it is suggested that the patient
have a neurology workup either at rehabilitation or as an
outpatient.  In discussion with the patient's family it
appears that the patient is near his mental status baseline.

coronary artery disease, ejection fraction by echocardiogram
was 45 to 50%.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 291**].  The patient had been
transferred from the outside hospital on Lovenox and Aspirin.
These were discontinued.  The patient continued on
intravenous Nitroglycerin infusion.  As part of the patient's
preoperative workup a urinalysis was sent which showed a
urinary tract infection.  It was also noted that the patient
was significantly anemic with hematocrit down to 25.
Hematology consult was obtained for the history of chronic
anemia.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells.  Hematology Service felt that there was no
contraindication to proceeding with coronary artery bypass
[**Last Name (LF) 8059**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the patient was taken to the Operating Room on
[**2544-11-25**] for coronary artery bypass graft times
three with left internal mammary artery to left anterior

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] [**Known patient lastname 2673**] is the former
1.66 kg product of a 34-2/7 week gestation pregnancy born to
a 39-year-old G3, P1 now 2 woman.

PRENATAL SCREENS:  Blood type O-, antibody negative, rubella
immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, group beta strep status unknown.

PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS:  Gestational diabetes, diet
controlled. Amniocentesis was performed secondary to the
advanced maternal age and was normal. There were uterine
fibroids seen on prenatal ultrasound. On the day of delivery
the baby had a biophysical profile of 2/8 and a nonreactive
fetal heart rate tracing. This prompted a cesarean section
under spinal anesthesia. The large fibroids required a
classical incision for the cesarean section. The fibroids
were removed prior to delivery of the infant. Rupture of
membranes occurred at the time of delivery with clear fluid.
Apgars were 7 at 1 minutes and 8 at 5 minutes. The infant was
admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for treatment of
prematurity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT:  Weight 1.66 kg at the 10th percentile, length
44.5 cm, head circumference 29.5 cm. General: Small preterm
male infant. Pink and comfortable in room air. HEENT:
Anterior fontanel soft and flat. Nondysmorphic facies. Intact
palate. Chest: Breath sounds clear. Good aeration.
Cardiovascular: No murmur. Normal pulses. Abdomen: Soft. No
hepatosplenomegaly. A 3-vessel cord. GU: Hypospadias noted.

Moving all spine straight. Normal sacrum. Skin: Mongolian
spot over buttocks, a 2 cm x 1.5 cm nevus on the
back of the left thigh. Neurologic: Normal tone. Moving all
extremities. Appropriate reflexes.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory: This baby boy
developed respiratory distress over the 1st few hours after
admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. He was
initially on nasal cannula O2 that was later changed to
continuous positive airway pressure. A chest x-ray was
concerning for haziness, especially of the left lung field.
By day of life #2 the baby had transitioned to room air. A
repeat chest x-ray on day of life #3 was within normal
limits. Due to the unknown etiology of the respiratory
distress, the baby was treated empirically with antibiotics.

Cardiovascular: This baby has maintained normal heart rates
and blood pressures. No murmurs have been noted.

Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition: Initial whole blood glucose
was 41. Infant was treated with intravenous 10% glucose in
water. Enteral feeds were started on day of life #2 and were
gradually advanced and were well tolerated. At discharge he
weighed 1895 grams and was taking > 160 cc/kg of Neosure 24. 

Infectious disease: As previously noted, the infant was
treated empirically with antibiotics. A complete blood count
was within normal limits. A blood culture obtained prior to
starting intravenous antibiotics was no growth at 48 hours,
and the antibiotics were discontinued.

Hematological: This baby and mother are [**Name2 (NI) 148**] type O- and 
direct antibody test negative. Hematocrit at birth was 43%.

Gastrointestinal: Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day of
life #4. Phototherapy was started on day of life #3.
at peak with a  total of 8.3 mg/dl. On day of life 6 it was
6.5/0.3, phototherapy was d'c d and 48 hour rebound level was
6.1/0.4.
Neurology: This infant has maintained a normal neurological
exam d[**MD Number 149**] admission. There are no neurological concerns at
this time.

Urology: As noted in the admission physical exam, this baby
has a hypospadias. It was explained to mother why we woulld
not have him circumcized. He will be seen as outpatient by
urology.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Laryngeal mass.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Laryngeal rhabdomyoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9217**] is a 75-year-old
woman, with an extensive past medical history, who was
admitted to [**Hospital6 9218**] for increasing
shortness of breath.  She was diagnosed with probable
congestive heart failure and treated with intravenous Lasix.
While her respiratory status did not improve, she was
eventually evaluated by ENT where she was found to have a
superglottic mass on fiberoptic exam.  CT scan confirmed the
presence of this mass.  Then she was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 851**] at the [**Hospital6 273**] as an
outpatient and subsequently scheduled for surgical management
of this problem.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

Hypertension.

History of myocardial infarction.

COPD.

Asthma.

MEDICATIONS BEFORE ADMISSION:
1. Lipitor 20 qd.
2. Atenolol 25 qd.
3. Glyburide 5 qd.
4. Celexa 20 qd.
5. Effexor 75 qd.
6. Protonix 40 qd.
7. Regular insulin sliding scale.
8. Lisinopril was recently discontinued because of mild renal
   insufficiency.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2513-6-12**], Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9217**] [**Last Name (Titles) 877**] an awake
tracheostomy and biopsy of a laryngeal mass with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 851**].  She tolerated the procedure well, and her
postoperative course by systems is as follows:

1. NEURO:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9219**] pain was well-controlled with IV pain
   medication which was easily transitioned to PO pain meds.
   Her mental status was within normal limits.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9217**] was hemodynamically stable
   throughout her hospitalization.  Postop EKG was without
   changes.  She was not placed on a rule out.

1. RESPIRATORY:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9217**] had a tracheostomy placed under
   awake conditions in the operating room on [**2513-6-12**].  She
   tolerated the procedure well.  She stayed in the ICU until
   postoperative day 5, at which time the number 6 trach was
   changed to a number 7 Portex trach.  She currently has a
   number 7 Portex trach.  The sutures were removed on
   postoperative day 6.  The trach is held in place by a
   trach tie.  This should be placed snuggly around the
   patient's neck to allow 2 fingers between the trach tie
   and the neck, but this should be snug.  The patient is a
   very difficult intubation from above.  Extreme care should
   be taken so the trach does not come out.  If the trach
   does fall out, it should be replaced.  If it cannot be
   replaced, an ET tube or an endotracheal tube may be
   substituted for a trach at the time that the trach falls
   out.  From a respiratory standpoint otherwise, she was
   doing very well.  She was saturating well on room air.
   She was ambulating several times per day, and she was on
   her home asthma medication.

1. GI:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9217**] was currently tolerating a regular diabetic
   diet.  She was seen by nutrition.  Tube feeds were started
   in the early postoperative period.  This was transitioned
   to a regular diet after an evaluation by speech and
   swallow.  The speech and swallow evaluation consisted of a
   bedside blue dye swallow which showed a question of
   aspiration.  For this reason, a video swallow was
   performed, and a post swallow x-ray as well.  Both of
   these were negative for signs of aspiration.  Her diet was
   advanced.  She was currently tolerating a regular diabetic
   diet

1. GU:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9217**] was on her home PO Lasix regimen.  She was
   currently making good urine.  Her creatinine on [**2513-6-17**]
   was 1.2.  This was much improved from her preoperative and
   early postoperative creatinine of approximately 1.6.

1. HEME:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9217**] was transfused on 2 occasions during her
   postoperative period for hematocrit's around 26-27.  Her
   most recent hematocrit on [**2513-6-17**] was 33.1.  She does
   have a history of coronary artery disease.  She was also
   on subcu heparin, and ambulating several times per day.

1. PROPHYLAXIS:  Ms. [**Known patient lastname 9217**] was kept on perioperative Ancef.
   She had been afebrile.  Her wound was healthy with no
   erythema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year-old man
who was determined to have high grade meso invasive
transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, which was
extending superficially into the prostatic urethra.  He was
admitted for surgery.  On [**9-29**] he underwent a radical
ileal loop.  There was no operative evidence of metastatic
disease.  Surgery went well and he was then put in the
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and management.  It was
noted that he had respiratory insufficiency and remained
intubated and also on pressor agents.  The respiratory
insufficiency was felt to be most likely related to volume
overload.  He was also hypotensive and this was felt to
known to be diabetic and had to be monitored in this respect.
He remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit and his
pressor agents were gradually stopped.  He did have
postoperative fever and was treated with Ampicillin,
Gentamycin and Flagyl.  He remained intubated until
postoperative day four.  He appeared to be somewhat
encephalopathic following extubation and he remained in the
Intensive Care Unit.

He had excellent output from his urostomy.  His mental status
improved and he was transferred to the floor.  He did have
prolonged ileus and did not start a diet until [**10-5**].  By [**10-8**]
he was in very stable condition except for some diarrhea. His
abdomen seemed distended, but was nontender.  His ostomy was
healthy and pink.  A stool specimen was sent for C-difficile
titers and he was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
2.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes.

cover the hospital course from the period of [**3329-3-26**] to the date of [**3329-4-17**].  The remainder of the
dictation will be added once his disposition is determined.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Respiratory failure:  Patient through most of this time
period has remained ventilator dependent.  The patient's
original respiratory failure was presumed to be a combination
of both hypoxia as well as hypoventilation secondary to both
ARDS/pneumonia as well as a component of abdominal
compartment syndrome.  Patient initially during this time
period was transitioned from assist-controlled ventilation to
pressure support, and was initially doing well.  However,
patient acutely worsened with rising abdominal pressures as
by bladder pressures, and the patient was transitioned over
to pressure control ventilation.  He remained on this
ventilatory setting for a period of approximately one week
after which he was transitioned back to pressure support
ventilation.

Patient was gradually weaning on his pressor support
parameters until overall course was complicated by
ventilator-associated pneumonia secondary to her MRSA.
During this time period, the patient's lung compliance
worsened significantly, and required increasing levels of
pressure support ventilation.  During this time period, the
patient was diuresed fairly aggressively with intravenous
Lasix, and the MRSA pneumonia was treated with both
Vancomycin and subsequently linazolid once Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4200**]
developed a rash with the Vancomycin.

Over the next approximately 5-6 days, the patient's lung
compliance measurements improved gradually, and at the time
of dictation, the patient was able to be transitioned over to
trache mask ventilation.  He is currently on a trache mask
with very good oxygenation.  The patient currently appears to
be retaining CO2 which it remains unclear whether or not this
is his baseline, although this does appear unlikely from
patient's past medical records.

At this time, we are currently lowering patient's PAO2 in
attempt to increase his respiratory drive, and hopefully
improve his hypercarbia.  He is otherwise oxygenating very
well and is able to remain off the ventilator for possibly
permanently.

2. Pancreatitis:  Pancreatitis had largely resolved by
enzymes as of the beginning at this time on [**3329-3-26**].  Initially, patient was started on trophic tube feeds
with a postjejunal nasogastric tube.  He otherwise received
most of the nutrition through TPN at this time.  The patient
underwent CT scans to assess his volumes, progression of his
pancreatitis, as well as excessive fluid collection during
this time course most notably on [**3-29**] and [**4-11**].
Both of these abdominal CT scans showed increased persistent
necrosis of the pancreas, but no evidence of infection.
There were large peripancreatic fluid collections that appear
to become more progressively more organizing, but nothing
necessitating immediate drainage.

Throughout this time period, the patient's abdominal
pressures as transduced by bladder pressures as well as his
clinical examination improved dramatically.  As to the end of
this time period, the patient was having bowel movements,
active bowel sounds, and was able to tolerate gastric feeds
after an OG tube.  The patient will continue to have
occasional chest PTs to assess the progression of his fluid
collections and possible pseudocyst formation.  Otherwise is
believed to have no active surgical issues.  His pancreatitis
remains largely resolved by his enzymes.

3. Infectious Disease:  [**Hospital **] hospital course has been
complicated by multiple nosocomial infections.  Initially,
[**Hospital 101**] hospital course was complicated by a coag-negative
Staph bacteremia, which was believed secondary to due to one
of his many lines.  Blood cultures from [**4-2**] and
23rd all came back positive for coag-negative Staph.  The
patient was treated initially with Vancomycin and the lines
were removed and changed.

Shortly after the surveillance cultures from the 25th, 26th,
and [**4-10**], were negative while being treated.  During
this time period, the patient also developed a MRSA
ventilator associated pneumonia.  While there were no
infiltrates on chest x-ray, the pneumonia was diagnosed by
change in quantity and quality of sputum as well as
concomitant worsened lung compliances by ventilator.  The
patient also was treated with Vancomycin with this as well.
During this time, the patient appears to have developed a
drug reaction to Vancomycin, and was changed to IV linazolid.
The MRSA subsequently showed sensitivity to this [**Doctor Last Name 11**].

Patient's course was also complicated by severe sinusitis as
diagnosed by a CT scan on [**4-11**].  The patient was
evaluated by ENT, who recommended removal of the nasogastric
tube as well as conservative management with nasal steroids.
Afrin spray and nasal saline flushes to the nares.  Patient
clinically appears to be improving in terms of his nasal
drainage at this time.

Hospital course was again complicated by a second episode of
coag negative Staph bacteremia on [**4-12**].  The quad lumen
catheter tip subsequently also grew back coag negative Staph
suggested this also was a second line infection.  The patient
is currently in the midst of a 14 day course of linazolid to
complete treatment of this line sepsis.  He is currently
being evaluated for possible seeding with a transthoracic
echocardiogram.  Transesophageal echocardiogram will be
considered if bacteria persists.

4. Volume overload:  The patient outside of this time period
was grossly volume overloaded with over 32 liters positive
for the hospitalization.  Patient got even further volume
overloaded as his hospital course was complicated by
hypernatremia requiring large amounts of free water.  It was
believed that he was becoming intervascularly depleted
secondary to his active pancreatitis.  However, gradually
over the next week, the hypernatremia resolved, and patient
was able to be diuresed aggressively with IV Lasix.

Over the next two weeks, the patient was diuresed nearly
17-18 liters negative.  He is currently diuresing well and
gently.  He has become mildly contracted by bicarbonate, but
his BUN and creatinine had remained excellent, and we are
continuing gentle diuresis at this time.

5. Renal:  As stated above, renal function has remained
excellent throughout this hospitalization.

6. Hematology:  The patient has required occasional
transfusions to maintain a hematocrit above 25.  There is no
active source of blood loss, although stools were faintly
guaiac positive.  He has remained on gastrointestinal
prophylaxis, but there is no clear gross single GI episode of
bleeding.  It is believed that the anemia is most likely due
to overall marrow suppression from his overall illness as
well as daily phlebotomy.  We will continue to transfuse as
necessary at this time.

7. Endocrine:  The patient initially had a very difficult to
control blood sugar given his pancreatitis as well as
persistent D5 infusions along with TPN.  During his first
episode of coag-negative Staph bacteremia, the patient was
started on insulin drip to keep blood sugars less than 120 in
general.  Over the last one week, patient has been
transitioned off TPN and onto NPH insulin which has been
maintaining his blood sugars under good control at this time.
Patient also had a Cortrosyn test during a hypertensive
episode in late February.  This subsequently resolved no
frank adrenal insufficiency, although the patient did not
have a maximal response to the Cortrosyn stimulation.  He was
transiently on steroids while this was rapidly tapered off
after the largely negative Cortrosyn stimulation test.

8. Electrolytes:  The patient's electrolytes were overall
complicated mainly by hypernatremia, which resolved with
increasing free water.

9. Nutrition:  The patient initially was on TPN at the
beginning of his hospital course.  This was gradually tapered
off over the past week, and the patient is currently on a
goal rate of tube feeds through orogastric tube.  We are
currently evaluating whether or not patient will improve
significantly enough for a swallowing evaluation or whether
he will need a permanent feeding tube such as a PEG.

10. Disposition:  The patient is currently improving and
mental status improved daily.  Sedation has generally has
been weaned gradually, and the patient is interactive at this
time.  We are currently evaluating whether he is able to feed
him orally, at which point, he could possibly be discharged
both off the ventilator as well as on oral feedings.  As he
is currently doing well off the ventilator, he may not
require hospitalization at a chronic ventilator facility.

ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] was thought to be
a generally healthy 45-year-old gentleman who had not seen a
physician in over 20 years who presented to the ER with
complaints of increasing shortness of breath and was found at
[**Hospital1 **] to have significantly increased blood pressure to
180s-190s. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1205**] for further workup. He was initially admitted
to the medical service for management of his hypertensive
urgency and further workup of his dyspnea.

On exam, he was afebrile. His pulse was in the 60s. His blood
pressure was between 180 and 190 systolic with a diastolic of
95-100. He is otherwise breathing at a rate of 22 and
saturating 96% on room air. His exam was notable for a few
crackles at the bases of his lungs. But otherwise, his heart
was regular and otherwise there was no rub. He had trace
edema in his extremities. His exam is otherwise essentially
unremarkable.

His admission white count was 10.3 with a hematocrit of 42.
His BUN and creatinine were notably 32 and 1.6 and his blood
sugar was 194. His CK, CK-MB, and troponins were normal.
Notably, a chest x-ray showed no evidence of failure. But his
EKG showed some T-wave inversion in the lateral leads. He was
therefore admitted to the medical service for rule out MI and
further cardiac workup.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted as noted above. His
cardiac enzymes were negative for evidencing any myocardial
infarction. But given his significant risk factors, it is
felt that he needed to be worked up somewhat further. He
continued to have significant elevations of his blood
pressure which were controlled with combination of various
nitrate drips along with beta-blockade, diuretics, and ACE
inhibitors.

During this time, he was monitored in the cardiac intensive
care unit. He subsequently underwent noninvasive cardiac
stress testing, which did not show any evidence of ischemia;
but he was quite symptomatic during this time. Therefore, he
subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which in fact
showed 3 vessel coronary artery disease with elevated left-
sided filling pressures.

His cardiac catheterization from [**3391-4-14**] showed that
he had a left dominant system with a 90% stenosis at the
origin of the left anterior descending with an 80% distal
lesion. His left circumflex had a large trifurcating ramus
with an 80% lesion in all 3 branches and 99% OM-1 lesion,
which was intermittently occluded, and 90% lesion of the PDA.
He had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed periprocedural and
urgent cardiac surgical consultation was obtained at which
time it is felt that patient would most benefit from coronary
artery bypass grafting.

He was taken to the operating room on [**3391-4-15**] at which
time he had a 6-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with
LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA to OM, SVG to IR to IR, SVG to IR.
Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 97 minutes and the cross-
clamp time was 68 minutes. There were no intraoperative
complications. Patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery
recovery unit postoperatively intubated on Levophed,
propofol, insulin, and milrinone drips.

Postoperatively, patient's blood pressures were quite labile
requiring vigilant monitoring of his hemodynamic medications.
But we were able to stabilize his blood pressure and his
cardiac index. We removed his intra-aortic balloon pump on
postoperative day 2 without complication. He was difficult to
extubate initially secondary not to problems with
oxygenation, but problems with mentation. We minimized his
sedation and narcotics in order to allow him to clear, but
subsequently quite slow in clearing.

It was noted on postoperative day 4, the patient was having
significantly decreased movement of his left side and also
given his change in mentation, that there is concern that
neurologic process might be occurring. We attempted to rule
out any infectious and metabolic etiologies, which were
negative. Subsequently, a stat CT scan of the head showed no
evidence of major infarction, or mass, or hemorrhage. But a
neurology consultation was obtained, who recommended MR of
the brain, which showed diffuse multiple punctate infarcts
involving the white matter in both cerebral hemispheres, in
the frontal and parietal lobes, and also small left acute
cerebellar infarct. These were consistent with microembolic
CVA, which likely occurred periprocedural.

He was started on Plavix and this statin. But it is felt by
neurology that he should not be anticoagulated at this time
as there is no further source of emboli. His cardiac status
was also compromised postoperatively by multiple episodes of
atrial flutter, which subsequently degenerated to atrial
fibrillation. Electrophysiology service was consulted for
assistance in management of this and initially had the
patient scheduled for ablation of his A-flutter. But as it
converted to atrial fibrillation, it is felt he should be
maintained on Coumadin and amiodarone. Will subsequently
follow up with electrophysiology as an outpatient.

He otherwise never evidenced any sort of ischemia or
congestive heart failure postoperatively, and had good
results from his surgery. Patient notably came in
hyperglycemic. Workup included a HBA1C which was found to be
8.3, which was consistent with history of diabetes mellitus.
He was seen by [**Hospital 720**] Clinic who started him on a regimen of
oral medications and insulin and continued to follow him
throughout his hospitalization. By the time of his discharge,
his blood sugars were well controlled on combination of oral
medications and glargine at night along with an insulin-
sliding scale.

Notably, patient's white blood cell count was elevated early
in the postoperative period on postoperative day 3 along with
low grade temperatures with occasional fevers to 101. He was
pancultured at that time and his urine and blood cultures
never evidenced any growth. His central line was changed and
removed. But the catheter tip also never evidenced any
growth. His sputum cultures consistently grew out
oropharyngeal flora and his chest x-ray showed what was left
pleural effusion process, but could not definitively rule out
a pneumonia. He was therefore treated empirically with
vancomycin and Zosyn for possible pneumonia versus aspiration
pneumonia. Was started on a 2-week course of this, which he
will finish at rehab.

By the time of his discharge, he had been afebrile with a
white blood cell count, which had been trending down. As
noted above, the patient was anticoagulated with Coumadin for
his atrial fibrillation with a Heparin drip used as a bridge.
He did have a formal swallow evaluation which showed that he
was able to take liquids and solids without difficulty or
risk for aspiration.

By postoperative day 13, patient was alert and mentating
well. He was moving all his extremities with a slight deficit
in the left upper and left lower extremity and the strength
each [**3-19**]. His lungs were essentially clear bilaterally. He
was in a sinus rhythm. His abdomen was otherwise soft. His
wound was healing well without significant drainage, and he
only had trace edema in the lower extremities. His white
blood cell count was 15.5 with a hematocrit of 29.5. His
platelets are 366. His INR was 1.5. His BUN and creatinine
were 27 and 1.6. His weight was 115 kg with a preoperative
weight of 107 kg.

As he had been afebrile, hemodynamically normal, and was just
receiving physical and occupational therapy, it is felt that
he can be discharged to rehabilitation in fair condition.

He was discharged to rehab on the following medications:
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. t.i.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.12h.,
potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q.12h., Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., aspirin 82 mg p.o. once daily, Percocet 5-325 take 1-
2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for pain, Plavix 75 mg
p.o. once daily, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily, Protonix 40
mg p.o. once daily, Norvasc 10 mg p.o. once daily, Glipizide
5 mg p.o. b.i.d., amiodarone 200 mg p.o. t.i.d. for 4 weeks,
Ambien 5 mg p.o. nightly as needed, Flomax 0.4 mg p.o.
nightly, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once daily, Coumadin 4 mg p.o.
nightly with continued followup of his PT/INR for a goal of
2.0-2.5, insulin glargine 9 units subcutaneously nightly,
Humalog insulin-sliding scale, vancomycin 1 gram IV q.12h.
for 7 more days for a total course of 2 weeks, Zosyn 4.5
grams IV q.8h. for 7 more days for a total of 2 weeks.

He was to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 396**] of electrophysiology in
clinic in 1 month and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of cardiology in 1

ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 54-year-old
male who acquired Hepatitis C likely secondary to some
tattoos he had received who's course has been complicated by
cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.  His
hepatitis infractory to interferon therapy.  He presented
after full workup for liver transplantation as an outpatient
for orthotopic liver transplant on [**3133-3-2**] when a
suitable organ was available for him.  At the time of
presentation he had been afebrile and otherwise had no
specific systemic complaints.  On examination he was afebrile
and hemodynamically normal.  He was not grossly jaundiced
normal and he only had a slight amount of icterus.  Otherwise
he had no cervical adenopathy and his lungs were clear.  His
heart was regular. His abdomen was soft and distended.  He
did have a slight fluid wave and a mild rectus diastasis but
otherwise no hernias.  He was guaiac negative.  He had no
significant edema in the extremities.  In terms of his
admission labs, his preoperative white count was 3.2 with a
hematocrit of 36, platelet count of 150, prothrombin time was
14.2 with an INR of 1.3.  BUN and creatinine were 13 and 1.0.
His total bilirubin was 2.4 with an alkaline phosphatase of
315 and his ALT and AST were 110 and 177.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**3133-3-2**] and on
that same day underwent an orthotopic liver transplantation
without note of intraoperative complications.  He
specifically had a cadaveric renal transplant with piggyback
technique with portal vein to portal vein anastomosis,
hepatic artery anastomosis and bile duct - bile duct
anastomosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and
remained intubated and was taken to the intensive care unit
postoperatively for ventilatory support, hemodynamic
monitoring.  While in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit he had
nutritional support through tube feedings via intraoperative
replaced nasogastric tube.

His hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  He
underwent a hepatic ultrasound on postop day one which did
not show any evidence of hepatic artery thrombosis or
stenosis.  He had a good amount of flow.  He was extubated on
postop day one and was not requiring any pressors therefore,
by postop day two he was transferred to the floor and
ambulating.  The remainder of his hospital course was
essentially for advancement of his diet, monitoring of his
liver function tests which continued to progressively improve
and for immunosuppression.  In terms of his immunosuppression
he was given Simulack and Methylprednisolone with CellCept
perioperatively. Postoperatively his CellCept and
Methylprednisolone were continued.  He had Cyclosporin added
to this regimen on postop day one and continued to have his
dose adjusted backed on C2 levels which were drawn every
morning.  By postop day seven the patient was afebrile,
otherwise hemodynamically normal, he was tolerating regular
diet, not requiring any tube feeds or supplementation.
Otherwise had no respiratory issues and was ambulating
without difficulty therefore, it was felt that he could be
discharged to home in good condition.  By the time of his
discharge his liver function tests had greatly improved.  His
total bilirubin was 1.7 with alkaline phosphatase phos 237
and an ALT and AST of 205 and 41.  His hematocrit was 33.7
and his prothrombin time was 12.4 with an INR of 1.0.  He was
discharged to home on the following medications:
1. Bactrim, one tab p.o. once daily.
2. Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily
3. Fluconazole 400 mg p.o. once daily
4. CellCept 1000 mg p.o. twice a day.
5. Prednisone 20 mg p.o. once daily.
6. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day
7. Acyclovir 900 mg once daily
8. Cyclosporin level was to be adjusted daily.
9. Percocet for pain.

The patient was to have outside laboratory work done twice a
week with laboratory results sent to the Transplant Office.
He was to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.

Date of Birth:  [**3134-2-4**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NB


This is an interim history that describes the period from
[**3-16**] to [**3-26**].  Please refer to previous dictations for
earlier history and events.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. RESPIRATORY. The patient has continued in room air since
   time of last dictation. Caffeine was discontinued on day
   of life 39. The patient has occasional apnea and
   bradycardia of prematurity, but has otherwise remained
   stable on room air.
2. CARDIOVASCULAR. The patient has been hemodynamically
   stable since the last dictation. Has had normal blood
   pressures with no murmur. The patient does have a PICC
   line in place for purposes of receiving antibiotics.
3. FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION. The patient is
   currently on 150 cc/kg/day of total fluids. Receives
   enterally Special Care 26 calories per ounce with ProMod
   added. Had good weight gain. Weight on day of transfer is
   2625 grams. Plan is to discontinue the ProMod due to good
   weight gain when he is allowed to feed. The patient is
   currently NPO in anticipation of OR procedure today. His
   most recent electrolyte evaluation was on day of transfer:
   sodium 143, potassium 5.2, chloride 109, bicarbonate 28,
   BUN 17, creatinine 0.3.
4. GASTROINTESTINAL. The patient has been off of phototherapy
   since the time of the last dictation. Most recent
   bilirubin measurement was on the day of transfer, which
   was 0.2/0.1.
5. HEMATOLOGY. The patient has not received any red blood
   cell transfusions since the time of last dictation. Most
   recent hematocrit was on day of transfer and was 25.9. A
   clot will be sent with him to the operating room in case
   of the need for transfusion. The patient remains on iron
   and vitamin E.
6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. As stated during previous dictation,
   the patient did have blood cultures that grew Staph aureus
   on [**2-20**], [**2-21**], [**2-22**] and [**2-23**].  A spinal tap
   was performed on [**2-27**] which showed no growth. Followup
   cultures on [**2-24**] and [**2-25**], as well as [**2-27**],
   were "no growth." He was initially started on vancomycin
   and gentamicin. He currently remains on oxacillin. Today
   is day 30/30 of oxacillin, and therefore there is a plan
   for the oxacillin to be discontinued today. Infectious
   Disease was initially consulted at the time of the first
   positive blood cultures.
7. NEUROLOGY. As stated in previous dictations, the patient
   did have a subgaleal shunt with reservoir placed on the
   right on [**3134-3-2**] (day 26 of life). Followup head
   ultrasounds have showed decompression of the right
   ventricle, but with a left ventricle that remains dilated.
   Both Neurology and Neurosurgery have been very involved in
   the care of this infant. The patient has been receiving
   twice weekly head ultrasounds, which have showed a
   continued dilated left ventricle, although not increasing
   in size, with relatively normal resistive indices.
   However, head circumference began to increase over the
   course of the last week and a half. Head circumference is
   currently up 3 cm in the past 2 weeks. Today's head
   circumference is 34 cm. After much discussion, a plan was
   made to do a left sided subgaleal shunt, which will be
   performed today (day of life 50).
8. SENSORY. No hearing test has been performed as of yet.
9. OPHTHALMOLOGY. Most recent eye exam was on day of life 43.
   This showed a mature ophthalmologic exam.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

NAME OF PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIAN:  Not yet identified.

CARE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. He is currently NPO on IV fluids. However, at the time of
   re initiation of feeds, was taking 150 cc/kg/day of
   Special Care 26, with a plan to discontinue the ProMod.
2. Medications: Oxacillin was stopped on day of transfer.
   Continues on vitamin E 5 units p.o. daily, ferrous sulfate
   1.5 cc p.o. daily, and receives D10 with heparin at 1
   cc/hour through the PICC line to keep the PICC line open.
3. Immunizations. There have been none received during this
   period. Next immunizations will be at two months.


DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital3 27**] neonatal intensive care
unit.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Prematurity at 28 2/7 weeks.
2. Twin 2.
3. Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
4. Staph aureus sepsis status post 30 day course of
   oxacillin.
5. Patent ductus arteriosus status post indomethacin.
6. Post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus status post right sided
   subgaleal shunt.

Service:  [**Location (un) **]

HOSPITAL COURSE SINCE PREVIOUS DICTATION:
1. Altered mental status:  Patient's mental status continued
to improve throughout the remainder of his admission since
his transfer from the ICU and once his benzodiazepines were
discontinued.  He had several episodes of anxiety with
hypertension and tachycardia as well as flushing that were
considered secondary to panic attacks.  The patient was
therefore placed on a low dose Zyprexa at night, which
resulted in cessation of the panic attacks and resolution of
his insomnia.  The patient was also started on Prozac, which
he had been taking previously as an outpatient.

2. Infectious disease:  The patient was noted to have
occasional low-grade fevers, but eventually defervesced over
the remainder of his hospitalization.  Several days prior to
admission, a urine sample was positive for over 100,000
gram-negative rods,medial and the patient was placed on
levofloxacin for UTI.  The patient should receive
levofloxacin for a two-week course for what is considered a
complicated UTI as the patient had a Foley catheter.

3. Cardiovascular:  Patient was hemodynamically stable
throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.  As noted on
the previous discharge summary, he was started on a low dose
ACE inhibitor.  A beta blocker was subsequently added given
some elevation in his heart rate.

4. GU:  A Foley catheter was continued for the patient's
previously mentioned history of urinary retention.  He will
need a voiding trial after discharge once his urethra has
healed, and his Foley can be discontinued.  It would be
helpful to have Urology consulted once the patient is
discharged in order to comment on his urinary retention and
incase he needs a Foley placed again.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is discharged to a rehabilitation
facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post urgent appendectomy for acute gangrenous
appendicitis.
2. Intensive Care Unit psychosis.
3. Hypertension.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Deconditioning.
6. Urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4. Combivent 1-2 puffs inhaled q.6h. prn wheezing.
5. Olanzapine 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
6. Simethicone 40-80 mg p.o. q.i.d. prn gas.
7. Fluoxetine 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. x11 days.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient will be followed by the physicians at
the rehabilitation facility.  He should call his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] to schedule a follow-up appointment
within 1-2 weeks after discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted directly to the
operating room on [**3341-1-4**] at which time she underwent
coronary artery bypass graft times four.  Please see the
operating report for full details and summary.

On summary she had a coronary artery bypass graft times four
with LIMA to the LAD and SVG to OM, SVG to PDA, SVG to
diagonal. She tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer she had an
arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter to atrial, pacing wires to
mediastinal and left pleural chest tube.  She did well in the
immediate postoperative period.  Anesthesia was reversed. She
was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.  On the day of
the surgery she remained hemodynamically stable in the
Intensive Care Unit overnight without any cardio active IV
medications. On postoperative day one her chest tubes were
removed and she was transferred from the ICU to 56 for
continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days, the patient did well. She
remained hemodynamically stable.  Her activity level was
slowly increased with the assistance of nursing and physical
therapy. The only complication the patient incurred was a
slight bump in her creatinine from 1.5 on postoperative day
one to 1.8 on postoperative day two.  Further review of the
patient's past medical history showed that she had a
creatinine of 1.8 prior to her cardiac catheterization. At
that time all nephrotoxic medications were discontinued and
we continued to monitor the patient's creatinine.  On
postoperative day four it returned to 1.7.  At that time it
was felt that the patient was in stable condition and ready
to be transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to
rehabilitation center for continuing physical therapy and
continuing postoperative care.  At the time of transfer the
patient's condition is stable.

Service:

Due to the status of multiple debridements, the patient had
lost considerable amounts of muscle tissue to his right lower
extremity.  His right lower extremity as a result of that had
significant muscle deficit which will need extensive physical
therapy.  In addition to that due to his extended periods on
bedrest, despite the adequate placement of preventative
boots, he developed an equinus deformity of his right lower
extremity which will also need to be extensively worked with
physical therapy as the patient becomes more ambulatory.  The
patient throughout all of this procedure and throughout the
multiple skin grafts had 100% graft take of his right lower
extremity and his right upper extremity and will have no
limitation to aggressive physical therapy ambulation and
attempts to restore him to his previous state of health.

The patient met criteria for rehabilitation.  Prior to his
discharge to rehabilitation the patient was taken off of his
Hydromorphone PCA and was given sustained release Oxycodone
as well as p.o. Hydromorphone Dilaudid to control his pain
issues.  However, throughout his rehabilitation course, we
expect the patient can be weaned from his narcotics and we
expect in addition to his improvement along physical therapy
lines, his PICC line be decannulated and as well his Foley
catheter be removed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient will be discharged with
Dilaudid p.o., Oxycontin sustained release p.o.,
Acetaminophen prn, Benadryl prn, potassium chloride,
magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate prn, Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Percocet prn, multivitamins with minerals, one tablet
p.o. q. day, Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d., Folic acid 1
mg p.o. q.d., Protonix 20 mg p.o. q.d. and the patient will
continue as far as his Paroxetine 10 mg p.o. q.d. and will
continue on her Lorazepam .5 mg prn.  The patient will need
continued antibiotic coverage for another two weeks.  It will
be oral antibiotic coverage, Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d.
for a total of two more weeks.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable condition, expect full
functional recovery with aggressive physical therapy.

Date of Birth:   [**2545-9-4**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Neonatology

HISTORY:  Baby Girl [**Known patient lastname 3099**] is a former 27-6/7 week infant,
whose care was transferred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4630**] of [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital 518**] Medical Associates on [**2545-10-3**].

[**Known patient lastname 4631**] [**Known patient lastname 3099**] was born at 27-6/7 weeks gestation by
spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 26-year-old gravida 1, para
0, now 1 woman.  Prenatal screens are blood type A positive,
antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis
surface antigen negative, and group B Strep unknown.

This pregnancy was uncomplicated until two days prior to
delivery with the onset of cramping.  The mother was
transferred from [**Hospital6 226**] with preterm labor and
positive fetal fibronectin.  The mother was treated with
terbutaline and magnesium sulfate, however, labor continued
to progress.  The infant emerged with spontaneous cry.  She
did require positive pressure ventilation and continuous
positive airway pressure in the delivery room.  Her Apgars
were 5 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes.  The mother had no
intrapartum fever and received antibiotics prior to delivery.

The birth weight is 825 grams.  The birth length was 34 cm
and the birth head circumference was 23.5 cm, all the 10th
percentile for gestational age.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:  Reveals a nondysmorphic preterm
infant with overall appearance consistent with her estimated
gestational age.  Anterior fontanel open, soft, and flat.  No
significant molding or caput, positive bilateral red reflex.
Palate intact.  Minimal breath sounds and minimal air entry
with positive grunting, flaring, and retracting.  Heart was
regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmur.  Femoral pulses
present.  Abdomen is benign.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Normal
back and extremities and appropriate tone and strength for
gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Respiratory status:  Infant was intubated soon after
admission to the NICU.  She received three doses of
Surfactant.  She weaned to continuous positive airway
pressure on day of life four and then weaned to nasal cannula
on day of life 22, and then to room air on day of life 29,
where she has remained.  She was treated with caffeine
citrate for apnea of prematurity from day of life one until
day of life 39.  She continued to have 3-4 episodes of apnea
and bradycardia in every 24 hour period.  Her respirations
are comfortable.  Lung sounds are clear and equal.

Cardiovascular status:  She has remained normotensive
throughout the NICU stay.  She was treated with indomethacin
for a patent ductus arteriosus confirmed by echocardiogram on
day of life two and three with resolution of the symptoms and
a murmur.  She had re-emergence of the murmur prompting
evaluation by Cardiology and recommendation of retreatment
with Indocin on day of life 15 and 16.  She did receive the
Indocin with resolution of the murmur.  A followup
echocardiogram on [**2545-9-20**] showed no patent ductus arteriosus
present.
Following discontinuation of caffeine patient began having
significant episodes of bradycardia, some unrelated to apnea.
Cardiology consult obtained and Holter monitoring for 24 hours
was done with the result demontrating 2 distinct
supraventricular mechanisms, sinus and or ectopic atrial
rhythm. There were 7 isolated APB's and 1 run of atrial
tachcardia duration of 3 beats and junctional escape beats
seen. Cardiology recommended Caffeine citrate for 2-3 months
duration. The infant was free of episodes for 5 days prior to
discharge.
She continues to have an intermittent grade 1/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border consistent
with peripheral pulmonic stenosis.  On exam, she was pink and
well perfused.

Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Enteral feeds were
begun on day of life seven and advanced to full volume
feeding on day of life 13.  Feedings were interrupted on day
of life 15 and 16 for treatment with Indocin and restarted
again on day of life 17, and advanced to full volume feeds by
day of life 19.  She was then increased to calorie enhanced
feedings of 32 calories/ounce of breast milk or preemie
Enfamil with added ProMod.  Total fluids at 150 cc/kg/day by
gavage feeding.

Prior to discharge she weighed 2.310 kg and feeding approx 150
cc's of Enfamil 24 cals.

Gastrointestinal:  She was treated with phototherapy for
hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity from day of life #1 until
day of life #18.  Her peak bilirubin on day of life #1 was
total 6.7, direct 0.4.  There are no further gastrointestinal
issues.

Hematology:  She received two transfusions of packed red
blood cells, the last one on [**2545-9-23**].  Her last hematocrit
on [**2545-11-8**] was 28.6 with a reticulocyte count of 9.8%.  Her
blood type is A positive, DAT negative.

Infectious disease status:  [**Known patient lastname 4631**] was started on ampicillin
and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk
factors.  She completed seven days of antibiotics for
presumed sepsis.  Her blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
did remain negative.  She has remained off antibiotics since
that time.

Neurology:  Head ultrasound on [**9-6**], [**9-14**], and  [**11-8**]  were
normal.

Audiology:  Hearing screening on [**11-5**] was normal.

Ophthalmology:  The first ophthalmology exam on [**2545-10-10**]
showed immature retinal vessels on the left and Stage I
retinopathy of prematurity in zone 2 on the right 4 o'clock
hours.  A followup exam on [**2545-10-18**] showed bilateral Stage I
retinopathy in zone 2, 5 o'clock hours on the right and 3
o'clock hours on the left.  A followup exam on [**2545-10-31**] showed
bilateral stage 1 retinopathy, zone 2, 4 clock hours od and 5
clock hours os.
Immunizations: Hep B [**10-21**], DTAP and HIB [**11-6**],Pneumococal and
IPV [**11-7**],Synagis [**11-9**].

Admission Date:  [**2846-9-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2846-10-4**]

Date of Birth:  [**2646-9-21**]     Sex:  F

Service:  .

ADDENDUM:  This is an addendum to the Hospital Course.

This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with an extensive past medical
history as noted above, who was initially admitted on
[**9-21**], with failure to thrive, dehydration and
weakness for four days prior to admission.  The patient also
had had abdominal pain with eating, diarrhea for four to five
days, with three to four bowel movements a day described as
watery and nonbloody consistent with multiple past episodes.
The patient was admitted to Medicine during her hospital
course.

The Gastrointestinal Service was consulted and an MRA was
performed which showed severe stenosis of the celiac access
and superior mesenteric artery, consistent with mesenteric
ischemia as well as bilateral renal artery stenosis.
Vascular and Cardiothoracic Surgery were involved and the
patient was referred to peripheral catheterization which was
performed on [**9-27**].

During the procedure, the celiac artery and SMA- were
centered, however, she also had a right heart catheterization
performed to assess the patient's filling pressures.  During
the procedure, there was difficulty in advancing the catheter
into the pulmonary artery.  This caused transient complete
heart block, so the patient had a temporary pacing wire
inserted with recovery to normal sinus rhythm with a new left
bundle branch block.

Post procedure, the patient was noted to be tachypneic,
hypoxic, and hypotensive.  She went into PEA arrest secondary
to the pericardial effusion which was tamponading her heart.
She was started on Neo-Synephrine and Dopamine at the
bedside.  A pericardiocentesis was performed with the
evacuation of 220 cc of bloody fluid.

The patient then had a repeat right heart catheterization.
The patient was then admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.

During her Coronary Care Unit admission, her anti-coagulation
for her atrial fibrillation was discontinued secondary to her
bleeding risk.  On the 18th, she was noted to have decreased
mental status and being completely unresponsive to voice and
the Neurology Service was consulted.

They felt that the mental status change were secondary to
possible anoxic brain injury versus metabolic derangement.
By the 20th, the patient's mental status returned to baseline
and the Neurology Service had signed off.  Of note, the
patient had been hemodynamically stable but intermittently
had episodes of atrial fibrillation.  No rate control was
initiated secondary to the history of complete heart block
and given the patient's surgical risk, it was unclear whether
or not she would be a good candidate for pacemaker placement.

After the five days in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient
was sent to the medical floor where she was stable.  She
received Physical Therapy.  Nutrition was consulted.  On the
25th, the patient's strength was improving and she was
clinically stable, so she was discharged to her
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Primary failure to thrive.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
ten years ago; rule out myocardial infarction.
3.  Diarrhea.
4.  Left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
5.  Ascites.
6.  Diverticulosis.
7.  Hyponatremia.
8.  Portal hypertension.
9.  History of acute renal failure.
10. Pancreatic insufficiency.
11. Status post complete heart block with temporary pacer
placement.
12. Grade I varices.
13. Mesenteric ischemia status post stenting of celiac and
SMA-arteries.
14. Cardiac tamponade status post pericardial effusion
drainage.
15. Mental status changes, now at baseline.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient should follow-up with her primary care
physician, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4144**], on a week after discharge and is
to call for the appointment.
2.  She was discharged to an extended care facility.

Service:  MEDICINE

ADDENDUM:  This is a discharge summary addendum to the
summary dictated on [**1-7**].

FURTHER HOSPITAL COURSE:  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had
a large amount of bright red blood per rectum associated with
large clots in the morning of [**1-8**].  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable.  He was supported with
transfusions.  As his bleeding appeared to be decreasing it
was decided to treat this gastrointestinal bleed
conservatively.  However, on the night of [**1-9**] the
patient had significant more amount of bright red blood and
clots.  Therefore gastrointestinal was consulted and the
patient underwent colonoscopy on [**1-11**].  Findings at
colonoscopy were many nonbleeding polyps.  the largest one
approximately 6 cm and sessile.  Biopsy was taken of this
polyp.  The results are pending at this time.  A few
diverticula in the sigmoid and descending colon were also
found.  The patient had no further evidence of bleeding after
the colonoscopy and his hematocrit remained stable after
multiple transfusions.

The patient's GJ tube malfunctioned several times during this
admission.  It eventually was not working at all and appeared
to be broken.  Interventional radiology will be replacing
this tube prior to the patient's discharge.

Cardiovascular:  The patient continued to have difficulty
with rapid atrial fibrillation.  The patient's Diltiazem was
titrated up and reasonable rate control was obtained.

ADDITIONAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Lower gastrointestinal bleed likely diverticular or from a
bleeding polyp.

ADDITIONAL DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Diltiazem 90 mg po q.i.d.,
Digoxin .125 mg po q 48 hours.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 65-year-old woman
with chronic lower back pain secondary to radiculopathy.  She
was admitted to the hospital on [**2739-9-13**] for removal of the
spinal cord stimulator.  A new intrathecal pump was placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Seizure disorder since [**2730**].
2.  Peptic ulcer disease.
3.  Status post [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] II.
4.  Osteoporosis.
5.  Lower back pain, status post spinal cord stimulator and
intrathecal pump.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Intrathecal pump (Baclofen, Bupivacaine, Dilaudid).
2.  Neurontin 200 mg three times a day.
3.  Lasix 40 mg twice a day.
4.  Fosamax 70 mg q day.
5.  Methadone.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] lives at home with her partner.
She had a two pack per day history of smoking for 35 years
but quit sometime ago.  She is an occasional social alcohol
drinker.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was admitted on [**2739-9-13**] for
removal of intravenous spinal cord stimulator and intrathecal
pump.  She had those placed four years prior for management
of her chronic lower back pain. She tolerated procedure well
and was placed on Cefazolin postoperatively.

Postoperatively she did well and was transferred to the
floor.  Initially she was placed on PCA and then switched to
p.o. pain medications.  She developed some urinary
incontinence subsequently a urology consultation was
obtained.  On [**2739-9-15**] she spiked a temperature of 102.8 and
an episode of desaturation down to 89% on two liters nasal
prongs.  A medical consult was then obtained.  A fever workup
was largely negative at the time.  Her white count was 7.4,
her urinalysis was negative.  Her cardiac enzymes were
negative.  A chest x-ray showed slight prominence of
pulmonary arteries bilaterally, no evidence of pneumonia.
She continued to spike fevers up to 102 degrees Farenheit.
Follow-up on blood and urine cultures were negative and she
was changed to Levaquin for antibiotic coverage.  Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **]
continued to have fevers and was subsequently switched to
Vancomycin and Zosyn for broader coverage.  A follow-up chest
x-ray suggested evidence of a left lower lobe pneumonia.  She
was continued on Zosyn and Vancomycin.  The patient continued
to have a fever and elevated white count up to 19.5. An
abdominal CT was obtained on [**2739-9-22**] which showed multiple
collections underneath the liver.  A general surgery consult
was then obtained.  She was found to have two loculated
abscesses in  the right subhepatic and a lower right quadrant.

The patient was sent on [**2739-9-24**] for percutaneous drainage of
the subhepatic abscesses.  She tolerated the procedure well
without complications.  The abscess originally drained 100
cc's of purulent fluid and a drain was left in place.  The
patient continued to have fevers and an elevated white count. A
repeat CT suggested that the inferior abscess might be
amenable to drainage.  On [**2739-9-25**] Mrs. [**Known patient lastname **] was brought back to
Interventional Radiology for drainage of the inferior collection.
She tolerated the procedure well and the drain was left in place.
The superior drain was replaced with a new one and 100 cc's of
purulent fluid was extracted.  She tolerated procedure well
without complications.

Subsequently, her temperature came down to 100.5 with
occasional spikes.  She continued to defervesced over the
next several days.  Her diet was advanced and she was taken
off TPN.  Cultures of the fluid collections showed
enterococcus, lactobacilli and fungal growth.  Intravenous
Fluconazole was added to her antibiotics.

She is currently ambulating well independently.  She has been
tolerating p.o. intake with no nausea or vomiting.  She has
had regular bowel movements and has been passing flatus.  She
has been switched to oral antibiotics and has been afebrile.
She will require follow-up CT.  She is currently stable for
discharge and will require follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

Discharge Diagnoses:

1. Chronic Pain and Spinal Degeneration
2. Peritonitis with abscess for loculated perforated viscous
3. Hypovolemia requiring fluid rescusitation
4. Seizure disorder

Chief Complaint:
STEMI
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cath with stenting
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 8033**] presented with an STEMI due to complete occlusion 
of her LAD.  She underwent cardiac cath, and three stents were 
placed.  This was complicated by no-reflow and final slow flow 
with poor reperfusion. Her blood pressure was maintained on 
dopamine and an intraaortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was able to be weaned off dopamine one day after cath, and 
her intraaortic balloon pump was weaned and removed the 
following day.  That evening she was doing well without 
respiratory distress and awake and alert when she developed 
sudden hypotension followed by asystole. A rhythm was restored 
during ACLS protocol but systolic pressure remined only about 60 
despite high-dose dopamine and norepinephrine. Echocardiogram 
showed severe mitral regurgitation consistent with probable 
papillary muscle rupture. Echo earlier in the day showed no 
significant mitral regurgitation.  Blood pressure was unable to 
be maintained and she expired.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent cystoprostatectomy and ileal conduit for 
muscle invasic bladder CA.  Patient was trasnfered to the SICU 
and was extubated the following day without any difficulty.  He 
was then discharged to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 4704**] late on postop day 1.  His NG 
tube remained in.  On POD 2, intern paged early in the morning 
about sudden onset right lower calf pain.  Patient examined and 
short history taken.  He denied any chest pain, shortness of 
breath or palpitations.  Calf was soft and nontender.  Leg USS 
the following morning did not show any evidence of a DVT.  
Examination later on revealed a warm knee and the patient was 
unable to flex or extend his knee.  On POD 3, rheumatology was 
consulted and they withdrew sinovial fluid from his knee.  No 
signs of infection.  Toradol helped to improve his pain.  On POD 
4, we advanced his diet to full, but he had problems getting off 
oxygen.  Patient walked around without oxygen, but his O2 sat 
dropped to the low 80s.  Pulmonology consulted and had 
recommended changing his inhaler medications. d/c standing order 
of Q3 nebulizers.  They also recommended pulmonary rehab after 
discharge from the hosptial.  On POD 5, he had some low urine 
output overnight which picked up later on in the day.  His knee 
stared to hurt again and rheumatology recommended starting 
nabumetone 500mg qd/bid for his pain.  Cultures came back 
negative.  Remainder of JP drains were removed on [**8-9**].  Patient 
continuing to improve and was ready for d/c on Friday, but the 
discharge coordinators were unable to obtain him a bed.  He had 
no issues over the weekend and is ready to leave.  On Monday, a 
bed was obtained for him at a pulmonary reahab center.  His 
urostomy site is intact and he has an abdominal binder on for 
midline incision.

Date of Birth:   [**2619-4-12**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOVASC

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old male
who only past medical history consisted of tobacco abuse, who
was complaining of substernal chest pressure with
diaphoresis, while working at his autobody shop the day of
admission, which is [**2684-7-1**].  He presented to the
primary care physician office that day, where he was found to
have inferolateral ST elevations.  He was treated with
sublingual nitroglycerin and heparin, as well as receiving 40
mg of ....................at 6:20 PM that day.  The patient
had no evidence of chest pain since he arrival to our
hospital at 8 PM.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:   Occasional aspirin for
degenerative joint disease.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
[**2684-7-2**], which revealed three-vessel coronary artery
disease with preserved ejection fraction.  The patient
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four on
[**2684-7-3**] with left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending; left radial artery to the posterior
descending coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to the
OM1 and OM2 sequential.  The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on Nitroglycerin at 0.5 mcg per
kilo per minute in stable condition being A-V paced with an
underlying sinus bradycardia.  The patient was extubated the
same day as the surgery.  A low dose of Neo-Synephrine was
started for his persistent systolic blood pressure being in
the low 90s.  The left hand remained well perfused with a
normal plus wave.  The plan was to have the patient
transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day #1, the patient remained afebrile.
Vital signs were stable with heart rate of 89 in sinus
rhythm.  The patient had been extubated the prior day.  The
labs revealed the following:  White count of 12.2, hematocrit
25.2, platelet count 214,000, sodium 137, potassium 4.6, BUN
11, creatinine 0.8, glucose 104 on Neo-Synephrine at 2 and
nitroglycerin at 0.5.

The physical examination was benign  Plan was to start Imd[**MD Number 9021**] to wean the nitroglycerin, as well as the Neo-Synephrine
as tolerated; Imd[**MD Number 5281**] the radial artery harvest and to
transfer to the floor when off the drip.

On postoperative day #2, the patient had no complaints
overnight with a low-grade fever of 99.6, somewhat
tachycardiac with a heart rate ranging from 105 to 140.  The
patient was saturating at 99% on two liters.  The heart rate
was irregularly irregular on physical examination with an
otherwise, unremarkable physical examination.  Amiodarone
bolus was given and the plan was to started on Amiodarone
400  mg PO t.i.d. for the atrial fibrillation.

The patient was noted to be somewhat pleasantly confused all
night the prior evening.  The atrial fibrillation was
documented as beginning around 5 o'clock that morning,
postoperative day #1 with ventricular rates in the 120s.  The
patient was given 5 mg IV push of Lopressor times two, as
well as the Amiodarone bolus.  He was converted to normal
sinus rhythm that morning at 8 AM.

On postoperative day #3, the patient had no complaints
overnight.  The patient remained with a low-grade fever of
99.2.  Vital signs were stable.  He was in sinus rhythm with
a heart rate of 84 in stable condition.  However, the patient
continued to remain confused and received a 1:1 sitter for
the confusion and for fall precautions.

On postoperative day #4, the patient had no complaints
overnight.  The patient was afebrile, vital signs were
stable.  The patient was still in sinus rhythm.  Plan was to
discontinue the sitter and to plan for a potential discharge
date of [**2684-7-8**].

LABORATORY DATA:  Current labs revealed the following:  White
count of 7.7, hematocrit of 23.9, platelet count 256,000,
sodium 139, potassium 4, BUN 16, creatinine 0.9, glucose 105.

Anticipated discharge medications:  Imdur 60 mg PO q.d. for
three months; Aspirin 325 mg q.d.; Amiodarone PO 400 mg q.d.;
Metoprolol 50 mg PO b.i.d.; Lasix 40 mg PO q.d. for ten days;
potassium chloride 20 mg PO q.d. for ten days; Tylenol 650 mg
PO q.6h.p.r.n.; Ibuprofen 400 mg PO q.6.p.r.n.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

Unit No:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6344**]
Admission Date: [**2951-2-6**]
Discharge Date: [**2951-3-10**]
Date of Birth:  [**2951-2-6**]
Sex:  M
Service:  Neonatology 


Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] [**Known patient lastname 390**], twin #2, is a 32 and [**3-13**] week twin admitted
to the NICU with prematurity and respiratory distress. He was
born at 1:57 a.m. on [**2951-2-6**], as a 1590 gram product of
a 32 and [**3-13**] week twin gestation to a 34-year-old gravida III,
para 0 to II mother with [**Name2 (NI) 711**] of [**2951-3-30**]. Prenatal labs
included blood type O positive, antibody negative, RPR
nonreactive, rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, and GBS unknown.
     
Maternal history was notable for 1 previous AB and 1 previous
ectopic pregnancy. This pregnancy was notable for IVF
assisted di/di twin gestation with concordant growth.
Pregnancy was complicated by cervical shortening prompting
admission from [**12-10**] to [**2951-2-1**], with
betamethasone treatment. At clinic visit on [**2951-2-5**],
she had elevated blood pressures and was referred for
evaluation. She was noted to have borderline blood pressures
without other evidence of preeclampsia, mild cervical
dilatation, and irregular contractions, and she was admitted
for evaluation. Ultrasound showed biophysical profile of 8/8
twice with normal amniotic fluid volume and EFW 31% and 18%,
respectively, and vertex/breech presentation.
     
Early on the morning of delivery, maternal fever was noted
and she was not given intrapartum antibiotics. Rupture of
membranes in twin #1 occurred one hour prior to delivery and
rupture of membranes for this twin occurred at delivery.
C-section was performed under general anesthesia.  At
delivery, twin #2 emerged with moderate tone and weak cry
requiring vigorous stimulation, blow by oxygen and facial
CPAP for resuscitation. Apgars were 6 and 7 at one and five
minutes, respectively.

The infant was brought to the NICU. In NICU, moderate work of
breathing was noted and the infant was begun on CPAP. 
     
Admission Exam:     
Wt 1590 grams, 25 to 50th percentile, head circumference 31
cm, 50 to 75th percentile, length 43.5 cm, 50 to 75th
percentile.  Temperature 96.6, heart rate 160 with a mean
blood pressure 36, O2 saturation 82% in room air. On CPAP of
6, FiO2 of 25%, O2 saturation was 90%. In general, the infant
was well developed premature infant, responsive to exam with
mild distress on CPAP. HEENT: Fontanelles were soft and flat.
Palate intact. Ears and nares normal with red reflex present.
Chest was moderately well aerated with CPAP. The baby had
mild retractions. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, no
murmur, 2+ femoral pulses. Abdomen soft, no
hepatosplenomegaly, no masses. GU: Normal male, testes
descended bilaterally. Anus patent. Extremities, hips, back
normal. No lesions. 
     
Hospital Course by Systems:     
     
Respiratory: He was intubated on day of life 1, subsequently
given Survanta x2. He was extubated to CPAP on day of life 4
and transitioned to room air on day of life 6.   Since [**2951-2-11**] he has not had apnea.

Cardiovascular: The baby does have an intermittent soft
musical murmur that does radiate to the axilla. This is
likely a flow murmur or peripheral pulmonic stenosis (PPS).
The murmur should be continued to be followed as an
outpatient by the pediatrician.

Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition: The baby was initially
NPO. Feeds were started on day of life 5 and gradually
increased to a maximum of 26 calories. Prior to discharge,
his calories were dropped to 24 calories per ounce of breast
milk or special care formula. 
     
Peak bilirubin was 9.9 on day of life two.  Phototherapy
was provided from day of life 1 to 8.  Last bilirubin level
was 6.6/0.4 on [**2-15**], day of life 9.  
 
Discharge weight 2495 grams. 

Hematology: The patient has never required a blood
transfusion. He was started on iron on [**2-16**] and has
remained on iron throughout hospitalization.  He will continue
iron supplementation as an outpatient at 2 mg/kg/day.  

Infectious disease: The baby was initially a sepsis evaluation
and was begun on antibiotics.  Antibiotics were discontinued
when the blood culture on admission was negative at 48
hours. There are no current infectious disease concerns.

Neurology: Because the baby was [**Name2 (NI) 302**] at greater tha 32 weeks'
gestation and 1500 grams, a head ultrasound was not indicated.

Sensory: Audiology: Hearing screen was performed prior to
discharge and the infant passed in both ears.  
 
Ophthalmology: The baby did not meet criteria for screening
eye exams.

Discharge disposition: Home
     
Discharge condition: Good
     
Pediatrician: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3102**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3103**], [**Location (un) 1885**] House
              [**Location (un) 3104**]

              Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]     
 
CARE/RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  The baby will be discharged home on breast milk or
    Similac 24
2.  Medications will include ferrous sulfate 2 mg/kg/day =
    Ferinsol (25 mg/ml) 0.2 ml po daily.  
    Iron and Vitamin D supplementation:
    a.   Iron supplementation is recommended for preterm and
        low birth weight infants until 12 months corrected
        age.
    b.   All infants fed predominantly breast milk should
        receive vitamin D supplementation at 200
        International Units (may be provided as a
        multi-vitamin preparation) daily until 12 months
        corrected age.
3.  Car seat screening given and passed.
4.  Newborn screens have been sent per protocol with the most
    recent results with no concerns. 
5.  He received his hepatitis B vaccine on [**2951-2-26**].
6.  Immunizations recommended: 
    a.  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from
        November through March for infants who meet any of
        the following 3 criteria: 1. Born at less than 32
        weeks, 2. Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the
        following: Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the
        household, neuromuscular disease, airway anomalies or
        school age sibling, and 3. With chronic lung disease.
    b.  Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the
        fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.
        Before this age (and for the first 24 months of the
        child's life), immunization against influenza is
        recommended for household contacts and out of home
        caregivers.
    c.  This infant has not received rotavirus vaccine.  The
        American Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial
        vaccination of preterm infants at or following
        discharge from the hospital if they are clinically
        stable and at least 6 weeks but fewer than 12 weeks
        of age.
7.  Follow-up appointments scheduled/recommended: The baby
    should have an appointment with the pediatrician within
    48 hours of discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Prematurity at 32 and 4/7 weeks.
2.  Respiratory distress syndrome.
3.  Apnea of prematurity.     
4.  Hyperbilirubinemia.
5.  Rule out sepsis.
6.  Cardiac murmur likely flow versus PPS.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname 12545**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 13**] from [**Hospital1 12544**] Commons on 
[**3412-10-29**] for resection of an extrinsic source of airway 
compression (i.e. substernal goiter) and underwent a 
bronchoscopy with microdebridement, partial sternotomy with left 
total and right subtotal thyroidectomy, and revision of her 
longstanding tracheostomy (to allow better phonation and 
communication) on [**3412-11-2**].  She tolerated the procedure well.  
For details of the procedures, see operative dictations.

Post-operatively, she was transferred to the Cardiac surgery 
recovery unit (CSRU) and was eventually weaned from the 
ventilator on POD 2.  A bedside swallow evaluation showed no 
overt evidence of aspiration.  Her diet was slowly advanced to a 
regular dysphagia diet which was well-tolerated by discharge.

On POD 6, she was found to have a urinary tract infection 
growing Klebsiella, Proteus and E.coli (resistant to 
floroquinolones but sensitive to ceftriaxone and prescribed).  
She was also febrile and found to have Coag pos., methicillin 
resistant Staph. aureus grow from both anaerobic and aerobic 
blood culture bottles for which she was eventually started on 
vancomycin.

On POD 7, she underwent both rigid and flexible bronchoscopies 
with placement of a T-tube in addition to a central venous line. 
 Post-operatively, she was re-cultured for fever and found to 
have Coag neg. Staph. aureus.  She was also noted to have a 
suprasternal hematoma which was stable and not felt to be 
clinically significant.  She had been intermittently febrile 
therafter but defervesced by POD 13.  In anticipation of her 
discharge, her CVL was removed after she had a PICC line placed 
on POD 14 for continued antibiotic coverage.  (CVL tip culture 
still no growth and pending at discharge.)  Lastly, on POD 14, a 
sputum culture grew MRSA.

On POD 16, she was deemed stable and tolerating her regular 
dysphagia diet.  She was also afebrile for 48 hours.  She was 
therefore discharged to her Rehab facility in good condition 
with recommendations to follow-up with Drs. [**Name5 (PTitle) **] (Thoracic 
Surgery) in 2 weeks and [**Doctor Last Name **] (Interventional 
Pulmonology) in 4-6 weeks.  She is to maintain her intravenous 
antibiotics for an additional 3 weeks and keep her T-tube capped 
at all times, if possible.  Lastly, a work-up for her adrenal 
mass was negative to date for pheochromocytoma but will be 
completed as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (Endocrinology).

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 55-year-old male
found down and unresponsive by a cab driver.  Brought to the
Emergency Room by the cab driver.  GCS was 3.  He was
bleeding from his head.  Head CT shows a large acute right
subdural hematoma.  Right pupil was 8 mm and nonreactive.

Patient was brought emergently to the OR for evacuation of
subdural hematoma by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  There were no intraoperative
complications.

Other injuries include superficial abrasions to both lower
extremities, his shins, right wrist.  Per Ortho, wrist x-rays
show old injury, no new fracture, and an occipital
laceration, which was stapled in the OR.

On [**3444-4-14**], patient's vital signs were stable.
Neurologically he remained intubated and sedated.  His pupils
were reactive and symmetric at 5 down to 4 mm and moving the
left greater than right to stimulation.  Opens his eyes to
stimulation.  Localizes in the left briskly.

On [**3444-4-15**], patient remained intubated.  He was localizing
in the right side, posturing in the left side.  Gaze was
dysconjugate.  Right was 2.5 down to 2 mm, left 2 down to 1.4
mm.  His dressing was clean, dry, and intact, and he was
withdrawing his lower extremities.

Patient had repeat head CT, which showed right new
temporoparietal infarct on the right side.  The patient had
been extubated, and then had to be reintubated for
respiratory distress.

On [**3444-4-16**], patient's his gaze continued to be
dysconjugate.  Right 3 down to 2.5, the left 3 down to 2.5
and sluggish, reactive on the left, localizing briskly on the
right, extending, external rotation of the left upper,
withdrawing lowers.

Patient's condition remained unchanged.  Family meeting was
held, and the family wanted to make the patient comfort
measures, although they wanted results of a MRI scan before
making that final decision.  So they remained in the ICU
until [**3444-4-23**] when a MRI of the brain was done.  MRI
showed extensive infarct on right temporoparietal area.

The patient was made comfort measures only on [**3444-4-24**].
Patient passed away on [**3444-4-25**] at 9:45 a.m.

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 30-year-old man with subdural hematoma and 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Please evaluate for progression. 

TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.

FINDINGS: Compared to the prior examination of [**2799-11-6**], the tiny intraparenchymal hemorrhage at the superior right 
frontal lobe has slightly evolved, continues to be present. 
There is no increase in its size. The tiny left parietal 
subdural hematoma layering down to the tentorium is also 
unchanged. There may be a small amount of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage in the region of the left posterior temporal/parietal 
area. There is no midline shift or herniation. The [**Doctor Last Name 314**]-white 
matter differentiation is preserved. There is small amount of 
fluid in the sphenoid sinuses as well as some opacity in the 
ethmoid sinuses. The scalp hematomas are unchanged as before.

IMPRESSION: No change in the small right frontal 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, as well as the left posterior 
parietal subdural hematoma and the small amounts of subarachnoid

MR/MRA HEAD

INDICATION: 30-year-old male status post trauma with small 
subdural hematoma.

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1. Axial T2, FLAIR, gradient echo, 
diffusion. In addition, 3-D time-of-flight MRA imaging of the 
brain was performed.

Correlation is made with prior head CT of [**2799-11-7**].

FINDINGS: As noted on the prior CT scan, there is a small 
subdural hematoma on the left overlying the left occipital and 
left parietal lobes posteriorly. The maximum thickness of the 
hematoma is approximately 5 mm in greatest diameter.

There is a scalp hematoma overlying the right parietal bone. In 
addition, there is mucosal thickening noted in all of the 
paranasal sinuses. 

There is no evidence of acute territorial infarct.

In addition, there is hyperintense signal noted within the sulci 
of the brain bilaterally consistent with subarachnoid 
hemorrhage. On the gradient echo sequence, there are several 
small areas of susceptibility artifact in the right frontal lobe 
near the vertex consistent with small areas of parenchymal 
hemorrhage. 

There is no evidence of hydrocephalus, mass effect, or midline 
shift.

MRA of the head demonstrates patent anterior and posterior 
intracranial circulations bilaterally without evidence of 
significant stenosis or aneurysm greater than 3 mm.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with small subdural collection 
on the left posteriorly as well as subarachnoid blood and small 
foci of parenchymal hemorrhage.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery and 
Orthopedic Spine Surgery were consulted because of his injuries 
which were nonoperative. Because of his mental status it was 
difficult to assess him for posterior cervical spine pain and so 
it was recommended that he be maintained in a hard collar for 
4-6 weeks. Plan is for follow up in 2 weeks after discharge with 
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2003**], orthopedic Spine; he will have repeat spine imaging 
at that time.

His subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages were also managed 
nonoperative. He underwent serial CT imaging which revealed 
stable bleed. He was loaded with Dilantin and maintained on this 
for 10 days. There were no reported or observed seizure 
activity.

Because of behavior issues he initially required 1:1 sitters; 
these were eventually discontinued. 

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and initially 
recommended short rehab stay; he ultimately made extensive gains 
in terms of his physical and cognitive abilities and after much 
discussion with patient and his girlfriend he was discharged to 
home. He was given the telephone number for Behavioral Neurology 
for follow up after discharge.

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 78-year-old concentration
camp survivor with a history of known arrhythmias, status
post cardioversion, presented with a one week history of
increasing dyspnea.  He had some left-sided chest pain and
some pain behind jaw and ear which went away.  He had some
coughing and production of yellow sputum which was treated
with a Z-Pak.  He was also febrile and had decreased
appetite.  He stated that he had increased DOE and occasional
PND, occasional orthopnea and sleeping on two pillows.  His
cough had resolved already by the time he was seen by the
medicine service and admitted on the 28.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) History of DVT, 2) Chronic renal
insufficiency, 3) Pronestyl-induced SLE, 4) Chronic leg
edema, 5) History of atrial fibrillation, status post
cardioversion, 6) Status post cholecystectomy, 7) Status post
nephrectomy secondary to renal cell cancer in [**2837**].

MEDS ON ADMISSION:  Quinidine 325 tid, Pepcid 20 mg qd,
Zestril 30 mg qd, lasix 20 mg qod as needed, Norvasc 5 mg qd,
coumadin 3 mg qd, and alprazolam 0.25 mg bid.

ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

He was seen by the medicine service.  EKG showed an old left
bundle branch block with first degree AV block and left axis
deviation.  His chest x-ray showed tiny calcified granulomas
at the left apices and new bilateral pleural effusions with a
question of early right upper lobe pneumonia.  Blood cultures
were pending.

LABS ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 137, K 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 24,
BUN 35, creatinine 1.8, blood sugar 118.  White count 11.4,
hematocrit 35.4, platelet count 178,000.  PT, PTT and INR
were pending at that time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was referred in from [**Hospital3 148**], and
the patient was referred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 792**] for his new congestive
heart failure with effusions.  This was most likely due to a
recent MI.  Lasix diuresis was begun.  His baseline
creatinine was approximately 1.6 which was monitored.  He was
seen by ID.  PPD was placed to evaluate for TB exposure, and
rule out any active infection.  He continued to have all
these systems worked on to improve his medical picture.

He was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3003**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of cardiology.  He did have
crackles halfway up bilaterally.  His enzymes showed non-ST
elevation myocardial infarction with some ischemia.  He
continued on aspirin.  Heparin was held, as his INR was
supertherapeutic.  At admission it was 5.2 which went down to
4.3.  His beta blocker was held while he was in failure, and
the plan was that he would have a cardiac cath as soon as his
INR dropped below 1.8.  His hematocrit was at 35.6, and he
received some gentle rehydration precath.  He received IV
lasix for diuresis and continued on his ACE inhibitor and
remained on telemetry.  His creatinine was at 1.7.

He was seen by the heart failure nurse practitioner to
discuss his congestive heart failure and some planning for
home diet.  He was seen by case management.  He was also seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of cardiology and EPS service for some
nonsustained VT in the setting of his MI, with
recommendations to try beta blocker, or decrease his Norvasc
if possible.  A discussion was had about mapping him, but it
was determined that he should have a cardiac catheterization
as soon as possible as first line evaluation, as his INR
continued to drop.

He was also seen by the GI service, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3224**] who was
his former primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] continued with his
lasix diaphoresis, as he was prepared for cardiac
catheterization.  He had a hematology consult for his
longstanding, increased PTT.  He had no further NSVT.  On the
3, his INR dropped to 1.7.  Hematology recommended checking
additional factors including lupus anticoagulant, and noted
also that his quinidine could produce lupus-like symptoms.

He was seen by the EP service on the 4, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 623**].  They
studied him and saw dual AV node physiology with some
short-lived episodes of SVT that were slow.  Please refer to
their note, and they recommended getting his diagnostic
cardiac cath done, and then having his ICD after his cardiac
surgery and work-up.  They also recommended continuing him on
beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.

Hem/Onc saw him again now that he had been off his coumadin
for seven days, but his INR remained resistant and elevated
at 1.8.  They thought that this was possibly due to his
antibiotic which was causing a decreased Vitamin K producing
bacteria.  Antibiotic were already stopped, and they
determined there was no need for Vitamin K.  They were still
awaiting results of his factor panels and his lupus
anticoagulant.

He was seen by the nursing case manager.  He had a cardiac
cath done on the 5, and it was recommended intra-aortic
balloon pump be placed and the patient transferred to the CCU
prior to his operation.  He was seen by cardiac surgery
resident on the 5, who noted his history.  His cardiac cath
showed a left main stenosis and LAD irregularity, some trace
MR, global hypokinesis, a nondominant right.  Please refer to
the cardiac catheterization report.

His labs preoperatively were sodium 142, K 4.2, chloride 104,
CO2 26, BUN 37, creatinine 1.5, white count 7.0, hematocrit
34.2, blood sugar 108, platelet count 248,000, PT 16.3, PTT
56.9, INR 1.8 with positive lupus anticoagulant.  Blood gases
7.43/39/72/27/1.  His chest x-ray showed some mild pulmonary
edema from the 28.  The plan was CABG.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had his balloon placed and was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.  The patient was seen
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14**], with plans for more Vitamin K today
and FFP, if needed in the OR, for his INR, and plans to
operate on him on the following day after he got his balloon.

He was followed by hematology.  The patient was also seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2558**] from cardiothoracic surgery, the Chief
Resident, and on the 7 he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3 with a LIMA to the LAD, and a vein sequentially
from OM to his left PDA.  He was transferred to
Cardiothoracic ICU on a Nitroglycerin drip at 2.0 and an epi
drip at 0.025 in stable condition.

On postoperative day #1, he had a T-max of 100.2, blood
pressure 114/58, satting 97% at 3 liters nasal cannula, as he
had been extubated overnight.  His balloon pump remained at
1:1.  White count 11.9, hematocrit 32.6, platelet count
100,000.  Sodium 141, K 4.7, chloride 105, CO2 23, BUN 41,
creatinine 2.1, with a blood sugar of 125.  He was awake and
alert.  His heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  He had an
index of 2.5 with the balloon in and a mixed venous of 68.
His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His wounds were clean, dry
and intact.  He had no extremity edema.  He was on a dopamine
drip at 2.0 overnight, and this was weaned again in the
morning.  He remained with his Swan and his A-line.  He had
no bleeding complications postop, and hematology signed-off.

On postoperative day #2, his balloon came out.  He continued
on his perioperative vancomycin.  His creatinine dropped to
1.8 with a K of 4.6.  His hematocrit remained stable at 28.
He was on a Nitro drip at 0.75.  The lungs had decreased
breath sounds at the bases.  He continued on aspirin and the
Nitroglycerin weaned.  He was seen by physical therapy for
evaluation.

On postoperative day #3, he was started on the amiodarone
drip at 1.0 for new atrial fibrillation in the 70s, with a
blood pressure of 127/62.  His creatinine remained stable at
1.8 with a white count of 9.4.  His lungs were clear
bilaterally, but had decreased breath sounds at the bases.
He was switched to oral pain med.  He was restarted on his
coumadin.  He had a good urine output.

On postop day #4, he remained in atrial fibrillation.  He was
on a heparin drip at 600, coumadin dosing at 3, with a PT of
14.2, INR of 1.3, and a PTT of 52.4.  His creatinine rose
slightly to 1.9.  He had a normal rate, but remained in
atrial fibrillation.  His wounds were clean, dry and intact.
His lungs were clear bilaterally.  He remained on heparin
while his INR became therapeutic.  He was started on a PO
diet and had good urine output and was transferred to the
floor.  He was seen by the venous access nurse who noted that
he did not have good peripheral access.  He was seen by case
management and had a Cordis placed.  His pacing wires were
discontinued.  His line was changed over a wire to allow him
to continue to have central access.  He remained on heparin
with the INR climbing slightly now to 1.5 with a goal of
2-2.5 for his atrial fibrillation.  He received chest PT.  He
remained on an amiodarone drip, as well as his coumadin.

He continued to work with physical therapy.  He was seen by
the EP Fellow who recommended an ICD which could be done in
three to four weeks as an outpatient, and be followed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 792**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 623**].  Of note, his AST rose
to 95, with an ALT of 57, and a total bili of 1.6.  They
recommended holding his amiodarone until his LFTs were
repeated.  His amiodarone was held pending his LFTs.  He
remained in atrial fibrillation.  He continued on his
coumadin with the goal of 2-3.  He continued his ACE
inhibitors.  Amiodarone was held.  Plans were made for
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 792**], and to have his ICD placement done
in the Cath Lab on Wednesday, [**12-4**], and EP signed-off
until that time.

On postoperative day #6, he had no complaints.  He had a
T-max of 99.0, continued with his regular rate, remained off
amiodarone, still in atrial fibrillation, continuing his
coumadin, waiting to get therapeutic.  He was a little
unsteady on his feet.  This was discussed with case
management and physical therapy.  He continued his
anticoagulation pending his therapeutic INR.  He was screened
by clinical nutrition, and on the 14, his INR hit 2.0 with a
PT of 17.5.  He was out of bed to chair.  He was increasing
his work with physical therapy.  Incisions were clean, dry
and intact.  The sternum was stable.  He remained in atrial
fibrillation.  He was discharged to rehab with the [**Hospital3 1743**] on the following medications:

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin daily dosing with the last
dose of 3 mg the night prior, to be followed for a goal INR
of 2.0-2.5; captopril 6.25 mg po tid; ranitidine 150 mg po
bid; lasix 20 mg po bid; KCL 20 mEq po bid; metoprolol 12.5
mg po bid; percocet 5, 1-2 tabs po prn q [**3-30**] h; colace 100 mg
po bid; Milk of Magnesia 30 ml prn; Xanax 0.25 mg po bid.
They recommended his PT and INR be checked daily for three
days in a row and then qod.  Follow-up with physical therapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Status post coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3 with intra-aortic balloon pump.  2) Atrial
fibrillation.  3) Chronic renal insufficiency.  4) History of
deep venous thrombosis.  5) Pronestyl induced systemic lupus
erythematosus.  6) Chronic leg edema.  7) Status post
cholecystectomy.  8) Status post nephrectomy.  9) Abnormal
electrophysiology study with automatic implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement planned for [**12-4**].
The patient had been given instructions for follow-up with
electrophysiology and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 792**], his cardiologist, as
well as discharge instructions to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 14**] in the office in approximately four to six weeks.
The patient was discharged to rehab on [**2852-11-7**].

Admission Date:  [**2549-4-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2549-4-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2475-10-23**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient's chief complaint was acute
shortness of breath with a chest pressure, diaphoresis, and
nausea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted on
[**4-6**] to the Emergency Department complaining of acute
shortness of breath with chest pressure, diaphoresis, and
nausea.

In the Emergency Department, he was noted to have ST
depressions in V5, V6 and a question of ST depressions in
lead I.  He ruled in for a myocardial infarction with his
peak creatine kinase of 311 and a troponin level of 35.  At
that time he received aspirin, Lovenox, nitroglycerin paste,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o., and Lasix 40 mg intravenously for
hypoxia and a chest x-ray which was consistent with
congestive heart failure.

He was transferred stable to the floor on Lovenox which was
switched to a heparin drip and was placed on a synergy trial.
He continued on aspirin, nitroglycerin paste, Lasix p.o.,
Cardizem (which he was taking at home).  Captopril and
Integrilin were added, and the patient was scheduled for a
catheterization for the next Monday.

Prior cardiac studies included his ejection fraction was 60%
in [**2547-2-28**].  He had mild left ventricular
hypertrophy.  In [**2549-2-28**], his exercise MIBI was 53%
maximum predicted heart rate, but no symptoms of chest pain,
and no electrocardiogram changes.  His ejection fraction at
that time was 43%.  He had global hypokinesis, fixed moderate
lateral basilar inferior defects.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (The patient's past medical history
includes)
 1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy,
nephropathy, and neuropathy.
 2.  Hypertension.
 3.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine
of 2.3 to 2.5.
 4.  Status post carotid endarterectomy.
 5.  In [**2545**], he had a colonic resection for adenoma with
high-grade dysplasia.
 6.  In [**2546**], he had prostate cancer, and he had radiation
and transurethral resection of prostate procedure.
 7.  Status post orchiectomy.
 8.  Radiation proctopathy.
 9.  Anemia, multifactorial.
10.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post right
femoral-popliteal.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  He has
three children.  He was a 30-pack-year smoker in the past.
He drinks one alcoholic drink per day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was positive for diabetes and
prostate cancer.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., he was on a heparin drip,
nitroglycerin paste, Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Cardizem-SR 240 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.,
captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d., Integrilin drip, Colace,
ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.d., desipramine 50 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Casodex 50 mg p.o. q.d.; and he was also placed on
Tylenol, Maalox, and Serax p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratories
on the morning after admission were a white blood cell count
of 6.6, hematocrit of 24.2 (which had dropped down from 29),
platelets of 186.  Sodium of 142, potassium of 3.8, chloride
of 106, bicarbonate of 27, blood urea nitrogen of 59,
creatinine of 2.5 (up from 2.3), and a glucose of 147.  INR
was 1.2, PT of 13.3, PTT of 72.  Creatine kinase was 146,
troponin of 17.3.  Calcium of 7.9, albumin of 3.6, magnesium
of 1.9.  Total cholesterol of 158, LDL of 93.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**4-7**], the patient was noted to have
melena in his stool.  He underwent an endoscopy and was found
to have angioectasia in his stomach.  He had dropped his
hematocrit to 23.5.  He received a total of 4 units of packed
red blood cells.  He also underwent cauterization with
epinephrine and had no further bleeding episodes.  At that
time, the heparin and Integrilin drips were discontinued.

From a cardiac standpoint, he ruled in for a non-Q-wave
myocardial infarction.  He had no further chest pain, and on
[**4-7**] he underwent an echocardiogram (please see report
for full details).  In summary, the echocardiogram revealed
severe global hypokinesis with severe inferolateral
involvement.  His ejection fraction was noted to be 20%
to 25%.

He underwent a cardiac catheterization (please see report for
full details).  In summary, the cardiac catheterization
revealed a 40% occlusion of right coronary artery, 80%
occlusion of the left main, 90% occlusion of circumflex, with
an ejection fraction of 20% to 25%.

Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted, and on [**4-11**], the
patient underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times two
with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending artery and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse
marginal.  At 1600, on [**4-11**], the patient was transferred
from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Recovery Unit on propofol and dobutamine.  He was in normal
sinus rhythm.

The patient came to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit
with an arterial line, a right radial and a right femoral
arterial line, a Swan-Ganz catheter, two atrial pacing wires,
and two mediastinal chest tubes.  The patient did very well
in the immediate postoperative period and was weaned off his
sedation.  Shortly thereafter, he was also waned off the
dobutamine drip.

On postoperative day one, a nitroglycerin drip was started
for mean arterial pressures of greater than 90.  He also was
started on Lopressor and an insulin drip, and he was
receiving Percocet for pain.  Of note, the patient was
extubated on the day of the operation, later on that evening
at 6 p.m.

The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm with brief bursts
of atrial fibrillation and some ventricular ectopy which
resolved with electrolyte replacement and Lopressor.  Over
the next few days, the patient was noted to have some
confusion and agitation which was treated with Haldol with
good effect.  He occasionally became disoriented but easily
reoriented.

On postoperative day three, the patient was transferred from
the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit to [**Hospital Ward Name 290**] Six.  Once
transferred to the floor, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course.  He continued to have some episodes of
confusion but was easily reoriented.  His activity level was
increased with the assistance of Physical Therapy and the
nursing staff; and on postoperative day six, the patient was
deemed stable and ready for discharge to home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of discharge,
the patient's physical examination was as follows:  Vital
signs revealed temperature of 97.7, heart rate of 63 in
normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate of 18, and blood
pressure of 129/65.  His oxygen saturation was 99% on room
air.  Neurologically, he was alert and oriented times three,
followed commands and was appropriate.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal and reactive to
light.  He had no carotid bruits, and no jugular venous
distention.  Chest was clear with fine crackles in the bases.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm, normal first heart sound
and second heart sound.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His
abdomen was round, soft, and with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed his feet were warm with 3+ pedal edema.
Skin revealed sternal wound was intact with no drainage, and
the EVH incision performed on the left thigh was intact,
slightly scabbed over.  The patient's weight on admission was
94.3 kg.  His weight on discharge was 96.9 kg.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  The most recent
laboratory data from yesterday was a white blood cell count
of 8.1, hematocrit of 26.5, platelets of 253.  Sodium of 140,
potassium of 4.5, chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 24, blood
urea nitrogen of 54, creatinine of 2.8.  Of note, there will
be a repeat blood urea nitrogen and creatinine done prior to
his discharge.  Also of note, his captopril was discontinued
during his hospital course due to the increasing creatinine.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications on discharge include)
1.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

ADDENDUM:  Again, changes were to be made to the original
Discharge Summary and Discharge Summary Addendum.

The patient was originally to be discharged on [**3014-10-13**] but remained in the hospital due to an elevated white
blood cell count.  The white blood cell count was 15.2; which
was up from a prior value of 10.  The reason for this was
investigated with a computed tomography scan of the abdomen.
This study demonstrated multiple peripancreatic fluid
collections which were felt to be abscess cavities.  The
patient's white blood cell count reached a maximum value of
20; although the patient was afebrile.  He did have some
abdominal pain which was more severe than on prior days, and
he was unable to take an adequate amount of food orally.

The Interventional Radiology Department drained two fluid
collections; one of which was only a small amount, the second
of which was larger and drained approximately 30 cc of
purulent material.  A pigtail catheter was placed in this
fluid collection and cultures were sent.

Following this procedure, the patient had less abdominal
pain.  After a 4-day course of total parenteral nutrition,
the patient was finally able to tolerate liquids and
eventually solid foods.

The patient was empirically started on levofloxacin, Flagyl,
and vancomycin.  The microbiology report determined that this
was vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and the patient's
regimen was switched to levofloxacin, clindamycin, and
linezolid.  The patient was otherwise stable.  The patient
was ambulating with Physical Therapy assistance and was
tolerating a regular diet with supplementary Boost shakes
with each meal.  His hyperalimentation was stopped.  His
white blood cell count diminished from 20 down to 11.6 at the
time of discharge, and he was discharged to the
rehabilitation facility on oral antibiotics.

At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile with a
benign abdominal examination.  He was instructed to follow up
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 28**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in no longer than two weeks.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged today in
good condition; without pain and tolerating adequate oral
intake.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications at the time of
discharge include the addition of)
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once per day (for two
weeks).
2.  Clindamycin 300 mg by mouth four times per day (for two
weeks).
3.  Linezolid 600 mg by mouth twice per day (for two weeks).
4.  Hydromorphone 2 mg by mouth q.3-4h. as needed (for pain).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient was discharged
to a rehabilitation facility today and was to follow up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 28**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in approximately one to two weeks.

Admission Date:  [**3026-11-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**3026-12-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2962-9-1**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 6477**] is a 64-year-old
male with a known history of coronary artery disease who was
recently admitted to an outside hospital due to substernal
chest pain and pressure and ultimately ruled in for a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a peak creatine
phosphokinase of 117.  The MB and troponin fractions were
unavailable at the time of this dictation.

This outside hospital admission prompted the patient to
undergo cardiac echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction
of roughly 20% to 25% with left ventricular end-diastolic
filling pressure of 21 mmHg as well as evidence of severe
3-vessel coronary artery disease by wall motion
abnormalities.  Cardiac catheterization was a "poor study."
It showed a correlated ejection fraction of 35%; and again,
3-vessel coronary artery disease.  The lesions found on
catheterization were not known at the time of this dictation.
The remainder of the information regarding the patient's
coronary arteries are outlined in detail within the patient's
Operative Note.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 3069**] was evaluated at the preadmission testing clinic
on [**3026-11-23**] and was scheduled for elective coronary
artery bypass graft by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 78**] on [**3026-11-29**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   (The patient's past medical history
was significant for)
1.  An anterior myocardial infarction in [**3007**] and 1984.  He
had cardiac catheterization in [**3007**] and recently on
[**3026-11-9**].
2.  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.
3.  History of congestive heart failure.
4.  History of hypercholesterolemia.
5.  History of hypertension.
6.  Known coronary artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  He is status post tonsillectomy as a child.
2.  He had his humerus replaced in [**3023**].
3.  Status post injury to his left arm recently.
4.  His wisdom teeth were removed in the 1960s.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

FAMILY HISTORY:   He has a significant family history for
coronary artery disease and diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is currently retired, but was a former
PhD professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6478**] and multiple other universities
teaching Business and Marketing.  He has had a previous
history of tobacco as well, but quit in [**3007**].  His
cardiologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 28**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1088**].

HO[**Last Name (STitle) 85**] COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 930**] on [**3026-11-29**], and
taken to the operating theater where Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 78**]
performed a coronary artery bypass graft times four including
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery.  A right saphenous vein graft was harvested and used
as a bypass conduit to the right coronary artery posterior
descending artery, as well as the oblique marginal one and
oblique marginal three.  At the time of the operating a left
ventricular aneurysm was also found and three separate
sutures were utilized to plicate this aneurysm.  It was seen
in the anterior wall and was consistent with probable damage
that he had sustained from previous myocardial infarctions in
the 1980s.  Her pericardium was left open at the end of the
operation.  He had an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter
used for monitoring.  Two ventricular and two atrial wires
were present, as well as having two mediastinal chest tubes,
and one left pleural tube.  His mean arterial pressure coming
off of the bypass run was 60 with a central venous pressure
of 5.  His pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was 9, with a
mean of 16.

He was sedated on propofol and being maintained on
Neo-Synephrine.  He was brought out of the operating theater
and into the Cardiothoracic Surgical Intensive Care Unit
where he was weaned on the night of surgery.  He did well and
was neurologically intact postoperatively.

Cardiovascular wise, his Neo-Synephrine was weaned from a
drip of 1 mg/kg per minute down to 0 support.  After that was
weaned he was started on aspirin.  His Lasix and Lopressor
were subsequently held for blood pressure issues.

Pulmonary wise, the patient was given chest physical therapy
and incentive spirometry.  His chest tubes remained in place.
Gastrointestinal wise, he was advanced to a diabetic/cardiac
diet.  Renal wise, he was making adequate urine.  His Foley
catheter was left in place, and he was transferred to the
floor.

On postoperative day two, the patient was ambulating with
assistance.  He had received [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 279**] consultation who
recommended utilizing a regular insulin sliding-scale until
he was started on appropriate oral feedings, at which time
they recommended utilizing Metformin 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. and
to titrate to 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. for blood sugar control.
Additionally, they recommended that the patient receive a
dilated eye examination as an outpatient.

On the floor, on postoperative day two, the patient was doing
well until he was on the commode using the bathroom; at which
time his telemetry monitor had picked up a 32-beat run of
wide complex nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  The
patient did develop syncope as a result of this.  He was
immediately brought to the bedside.  His blood pressure at
this time was 120/70.  He was back into a sinus rhythm
immediately and was able to recover his affect and
consciousness without difficulty.

At this time, the patient had his electrolytes repleted.  He
was given empiric magnesium sulfate 2 g intravenously as well
as 2 g of calcium gluconate for an ionized calcium of 1.1.
Additionally, he was given 20 mEq of K-Dur p.o. times one.
The patient was placed on Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Given the fact that he had his aneurysm plication, as well as
a low ejection fraction with documented 30%, a history of
mild mitral regurgitation, the Electrophysiology consultation
service was consulted to evaluate the patient.  They
recommended the patient be studied outside of the 96-hour
window from perfusion, as it is typical for patient's post
coronary artery bypass graft to have nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.

On the same day, postoperative day two, after the
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the patient ultimately
ended up in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response.  His blood pressure was in the 100s to 110s
systolic.  His heart rate was 130s to 150s.  He was given
intravenous Lopressor 20 mg total over one hour which had
little effect.  He was loaded with intravenous
amiodarone 150 mg intravenously and started on an amiodarone
drip at 1 mg per hour times six hours and then changed to
0.5 mg times 18 hours.  He was ultimately transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours on postoperative day days
two through three for heart rate control.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the entire time and had no
further ectopy.  He actually converted to sinus rhythm once
he was immediately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
However, he stayed there overnight until postoperative day
three when he was admitted back to the floor.  He was
maintained oral amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.   His Lopressor
was titrated to affect, and Electrophysiology recommended
that the patient undergo a formal study on [**3026-12-4**].

Note, during the patient's postoperative course he remained
afebrile; however, he did have an elevated white blood cell
count on postoperative day three.  His white blood cell count
to rose to 24,000.  He had no identifiable source of
infection.  He had a chest x-ray that was completed after
removal of all of his lines and tubes, and at that time there
was no focal infiltrate.  There was evidence of bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right, as well as some
basilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  However, the
cardiac silhouette was stable with no evidence of effusion.
There was no pericardial friction rub noted.  He had no
productive sputum.  His sternal incision was clean, dry, and
intact with no evidence of erythema or drainage.  The
bilateral lower extremity saphenous vein graft harvest
incisions were also pristine and without evidence of
infection.

Due to the lack of etiology for the patient's white count it
was just monitored serially, and it subsequently defervesced.
It was felt to possibly be secondary to his acute stress
reaction from the operation and the demargination phenomenon
that sometimes occurs after a bypass run.

By [**3026-12-4**], on postoperative day five, the patient
was taken to the Electrophysiology laboratory where he
underwent a formal evaluation of his SA-node, and it was
found that he had a inducible AV-nodal reentrant tachycardia
as well as an inducible ventricular tachycardia found in the
regions.   An ectopy site was found in the region of his
aneurysm plication.  He ultimately had an automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator placed in the left clavipectoral
fossae through the left subclavian vein with lead placements
into the right atrium and left ventricle.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged
back to the floor.  Over the next two days the patient
remained afebrile.  His white blood cell count serially
decreased to 15,000 from 24.  His blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine remained stable throughout his hospital course
with a discharge blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 14 and
0.8.  His discharge laboratories were significant for the
white count as mentioned, with a hematocrit of 27.9 (which
was stable), a platelet count of 502,000.  Electrolytes were
within normal limits.  His temperature was 96.6 on
examination, heart rate 84 in sinus rhythm, and blood

Admission Date:  [**2618-12-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2619-1-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2552-8-14**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MEDICINE - [**Hospital1 884**]

ADDENDUM - HOSPITAL COURSE:  Please note, this dictation
covers the patient's hospitalization from approximately
[**2619-1-6**] until the date of discharge.  For his
previous hospitalization, please see the previously dictated
discharge summary.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 66-year-old man, with diabetes,
peripheral vascular disease, CVA, who was admitted [**2618-12-11**]
with persistent necrotic right heel ulcer to vascular
surgery.  On [**2618-12-17**], he underwent angioplasty with stents x
3 to the right superficial femoral artery, but was
subsequently transferred to the podiatry service for right
heel debridement and calcanectomy on [**12-29**].  Pathologic
exam and microbiologic data revealed acute on chronic
osteomyelitis with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus
epidermidis and Corynebacterium.

The patient initially did well postoperatively, but on
[**1-1**] developed shortness of breath, cough with white
sputum, a low-grade fever, orthopnea, and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, as well as a new hypoxemia.  Chest x-rays
revealed a new infiltrate that was either CHF versus
pneumonia.  The pulmonary team was consulted and recommended
diuresis.  The patient continued with an O2 requirement and
he was, therefore, transferred to the [**Hospital6 8125**]
on [**1-6**].

On [**1-8**], he developed increasing shortness of breath
with a PAO2 of 50 on 100% nonrebreather.  He was given lasix
80 IV x 3 without effect, and he was placed on mask
ventilation and transferred to the Medical ICU.  The patient
was successfully diuresed 5-1/2 liters with significant
improvement in his hypoxemia.  Initially, his antibiotic
coverage was broadened to include Levofloxacin, vancomycin
and Zosyn, though Levofloxacin and Zosyn were subsequently
discontinued per ID recommendations, given that sputum
cultures remained negative.  The vancomycin was continued for
his right foot osteomyelitis.  Given the patient's improved
respiratory status, he was transferred back to the medicine
[**Hospital1 **] service on [**2619-1-14**].

1) OSTEOMYELITIS:  The patient is status post partial
calcanectomy of his right heel with acute on chronic
osteomyelitis.  He will need to continue vancomycin for 6
weeks postsurgery, which will be through [**2619-2-18**].
Additionally, he is to continue nonweightbearing to his right
heel until he follows up with the podiatry service and they
clear him for weightbearing status.

2) HYPOXEMIA:  The patient continued to improve during his
hospital course, and on the day of discharge was satting well
on room air.  The most likely etiology of his hypoxemia was
related to congestive heart failure, although his underlying
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may also have
contributed.  For his heart failure, he will continue his
beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.  Additionally, to help
control his volume, he will continue on a low dose of lasix
that may need to be further adjusted as an outpatient.

3) DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient's sugars were quite
brittle during his hospital stay and rather difficult to
control especially with his varying intake with the
reintroduction of tube feeds as supplements for his
nutrition, given his poor nutritional status.  His NPH and
sliding scales will likely need further adjustment carefully,
as the patient had some trouble with some early morning
hypoglycemia.  This will need to continue to be monitored
carefully, as his tube feeds are tapered as his PO intake
improves.

4) GI:  The patient has a history of chronic dysphagia of
unclear etiology for which he is followed by his outpatient
gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 293**].  An EGD performed while in
the hospital revealed esophageal dysmotility, but no other
abnormal findings, and no clear etiologic cause.
Additionally, the patient had been having chronic diarrhea
for several months.  Stool studies were sent and were
negative for infectious etiologies.  Additionally, a tissue
transglutaminase was negative.  However, the patient did have
the presence of some stool fat on exam suggesting the
possibility of malabsorption.  This will need to be further
addressed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 293**].

5) HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have a chronic but
stable anemia while he was in the hospital.  B12 and folate
were normal.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of
chronic disease.  Currently, his hematocrit is stable.  As an
outpatient, he might benefit from starting Epogen.

6) DEPRESSION:  The patient had profound fatigue and somewhat
low mood while he was in the hospital and was followed by our
psychiatry consult service.  They recommended stopping his
SSRI and starting the patient on Ritalin which was done
successfully.  The patient's energy and appetite did improve
somewhat while he was on the Ritalin, and this is to be
continued as an outpatient.  Additionally, he would likely
benefit from psychiatric follow-up as an outpatient.

7) NUTRITION:  The patient came in with chronic malnutrition
and decreased muscle mass.  While in the hospital, he was
begun on tube feeds due to concerns that the patient was
aspirating while he was in the MICU.  Subsequent evaluation
by speech and swallow therapists revealed that he had no
signs or symptoms of aspiration, and he was encouraged to
return to eating PO.  However, he reports decreased appetite
and; therefore, it was decided to restart supplemental tube
feeds to increase his nutritional state.  This will need to
be followed up while he is at rehab with calorie counts to
assess how he is eating now that his appetite has been
improved with the Ritalin, as the tube feeds may need to be
tapered.  If tube feeds are tapered, then his insulin will
need to be adjusted to reflect that.

8) PHYSICAL THERAPY:  The patient is currently
nonweightbearing to his right heel until he is cleared by
podiatry.  Additionally, due to his prolonged hospital course
he is significantly weak and requires assistance with
mobility, as noted in the physical therapy page three
referral.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.  The patient breathes
comfortably on room air.  The surgical incision is healing
well.  He requires assistance with mobility, as the patient
is nonweightbearing to the right foot until he follows up
with podiatry.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To a skilled nursing facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Osteomyelitis of right calcaneus with Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis status post partial
calcanectomy.
2. Peripheral vascular disease status post stent placement x
3 to his right superficial femoral artery.
3. Congestive heart failure.
4. Hypoxic respiratory failure, resolved.
5. Diabetes mellitus.
6. Depression.
7. Esophageal dysmotility.
8. Anemia of chronic disease.
9. Chronic malnutrition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Tylenol 325-650 prn.
2. Timolol 0.5% eyedrops 1 drop to each eye bid.
3. Plavix 75 qd.
4. Flovent 2 puffs bid.
5. Heparin 5,000 units subcu q 8 h.
6. Regranex gel apply to his surgical sites.
7. Aspirin 324 po qd.
8. Atrovent nebulizers q 6 h prn.
9. Metoprolol 25 po bid.
10.Protonix 40 qd.
11.Vancomycin 750 mg q 12 h through [**2619-2-18**].
12.Captopril 25 tid.
13.Ritalin 5 q am and q noon.
14.Reglan 10 tid before meals.
15.Insulin NPH currently 15 U q am and 12 U q pm, as well as
insulin sliding scale.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient needs to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3285**]
of podiatry in 7-10 days.  He is to call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1051**] to
schedule an appointment.  He is not to put weight on his
right heel until he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3285**].
2. The patient is also to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1893**] within 1
week of leaving rehab.  He is to call his office at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8126**] for an appointment.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1893**] will follow-up on
the patient's anemia and consider starting Epogen.
Additionally, he will also assess the patient's nutritional
status and his volume status.
3. The patient would also likely benefit from a follow-up
with psychiatry.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1893**] can recommend someone.
4. He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 293**] in 2-4 weeks for
further management of his diarrhea if it recurs, and his
difficulty swallowing.  He is to call Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 7378**] office
for an appointment.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This infant was born to a 29
year-old gravida I, now para I mom with [**Name2 (NI) 148**] type O
positive, antibody negative, hepatitis surface antigen
negative, RPR nonreactive and rubella immune. Prenatal
course: Infant was born at 36-6/7 weeks gestation on [**3177-10-18**] at 10:55 A.M. by cesarean section for a complete
previa. Baby was also breech. The group B strep status was
unknown. There was no maternal fever. Rupture of membranes
was at time of delivery. The infant emerged well appearing
and active and had Apgars of 8 at one minute and 9 at five
minutes. The infant was brought to the newborn nursery. The
birth weight was 2850 grams.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well appearing infant.
Anterior fontanelle soft and flat. Normal S1, S2 with a II to
III/VI holosystolic murmur was noted throughout the
precordium best heard at the left lower sternal border but
radiated to the right upper sternal border. Breath sounds
clear and equal. Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities well perfused. Normal female genitalia. Hips
stable. The baby was a breech presentation. Anus patent.
Spine intact.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  CARDIOLOGY: Infant was noted to have a holosystolic
    murmur that persisted and was brought to the Neonatal
    Intensive Care Unit for cardiac evaluation. The O2
    saturation in room air pre and post ductally was greater
    than 95. The electrocardiogram showed upright T wave in
    V1 suggestive of a persistent elevated PVR. Chest x-ray
    showed no cardiomegaly, mildly increased vascular
    markings. Four extremity blood pressures were normal. A
    cardiology consult was obtained and an echocardiogram was
    done. This showed a large membranous ventricular septal
    defect with left to right flow. There was a patent
    foramen ovale with aneurysm of the septum primum. There
    was qualitatively good biventricular systolic function.
    There was trivial tricuspid regurgitation and trivial
    right peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. The patient
    was started on Lasix [**3177-10-22**] per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**],
    cardiologist at [**Hospital3 27**].

1.  RESPIRATORY: Breath sounds clear and equal with mild
    tachypnea and no grunting, flaring or retracting and O2
    saturations in room air greater than 95.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The baby had a bilirubin on [**10-21**], 2005 of 12.3/0.3 and a repeat bilirubin on [**10-23**], 2005 of 17.6/0.3 at which time the patient was placed
    under double phototherapy. The infant is O positive and
    antibody negative. The bilirubin [**3177-10-24**] at 4
    A.M. was 14.1 and phototherapy was discontinued at 9 A.M.
    A rebound bilirubin is recommended [**3177-10-25**] in
    the A.M.

1.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The infant's birth
    weight was 2850 grams (6 pounds, 4 ounces). The discharge
    is 2495 grams (5 pounds 8 ounces). The baby is trying to
    breast feed and is being supplemented after each feeding

Date of Birth:  [**2922-7-28**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NB

HISTORY:  Baby girl [**Known patient lastname 1380**], [**Name2 (NI) 790**] #2, was the 380 gram
product of a 24-5/7th week triplet gestation born to a 32-
year-old G4-P1 mother.

PRENATAL SCREENS:  A positive, antibody negative, hepatitis
surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, GBS unknown,
rubella immune and HIV negative.

PRENATAL COURSE:  Significant for spontaneous triplets.
Mother transferred care from Bermuda on [**7-9**] to [**Hospital1 3**] after spontaneous demise at 16-18
weeks gestation of one of the triplets. Infants were born
monochorionic-monoamniotic (surviving twins) and [**Doctor Last Name 2304**] as
a separate placenta and amniotic sac. In addition, course
significant for discordant growth in surviving twins with
recent weights of 511 grams and 298 grams.

Mother presented on day of delivery in spontaneous labor with
triplet with demise presenting. No maternal fever. GBS
unknown. No intrapartum antibiotics. No rupture in either
surviving twin. Infants delivered by cesarean section. Apgars
were 4 and 7. Infant required positive pressure ventilation
intubation in the delivery room.

BRIEF HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory. Infant
remained on high-frequency ventilation throughout her
hospital course with escalating settings over the last 2
days. Echocardiogram demonstrated pulmonary hypertension on 3
studies over the past week with right to left shunting.  No
improvement despite attempts to optimize oxygenation and
sedation.

Cardiovascular. Infant received 3 courses of indomethacin for
treatment of large patent ductus arteriosus over the first week
of life. Patent ductus arteriosus was documented as continuing
to be patent but with the new development of pulmonary
hypertension.
Cardiology at this time was unable to offer any surgical
treatment for the PDA due to the pulmonary hypertenstion. She was
on dopamine up until day of life #13 but then weaned off with
subsequent normal BPs..

Fluid and electrolytes. Birth weight was 308 grams. Death
weight was 510 grams. Infant was managed on parenteral
nutrition throughout her hospital stay.

GI. Infant was receiving phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia,
peak bilirubin of 3.1 on day of life #2. The issue was
ongoing at the time of death.

Hematology. Hematocrit on admission was 48. Infant received
multiple blood products for blood out and low hematocrit. She
also received platelets and FFP for clotting factors
initially. Infant had a low ANC at birth of 450 grams. She
had a persistent neutropenia with a shifted CBC last observed
on [**2922-8-6**].

Infectious disease. See above. Also, infant was receiving
ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin for a total of 14 days.
They were discontinued on [**2922-8-10**]. Blood cultures all
remained negative.

Neuro. Infant was active and appropriate for gestational age.
Head ultrasound x4 were all within normal limits. Infant was
receiving fentanyl drip in p.r.n. dosing for pain and
comfort.

Final course - Baby girl [**Known patient lastname 1380**] was made DNR on
[**2922-8-12**], due to change in her medical condition
including significant respiratory disease, pulmonary failure,
developing renal failure and pulmonary hypertension. Infant began
to have desaturations despite being on the ventilator and having
100% oxygen. Her heart rate began to drift slowly. Her parents
were at the bedside and expressed the desire for comfort measures
only. She was extubated while her parents held her. She died at
4:07 a.m. on [**2922-8-13**], from respiratory failure secondary
to extreme prematurity with renal and heart failure. Parents
declined autopsy.

# EtOH Dependence: Last drink on [**3430-5-3**], thus within window for 
severe EtOh withdrawal. The patient was given standing ativan 
and placed on a CIWA scale with supplemental IV thiamine and po 
folate.  The patient was initially monitored in the FICU and 
then transferred to the floor.  He was intermittently confused 
with periods of agitation.  A head CT was obtained with results 
listed above.  On the morning of 5/10 the patient was A&Ox3 and 
appeared markedly improved.  The nurse noted that he was not in 
his room.  Both the nurse and I searched the cafeteria and found 
the patient in front of the hospital getting into a cab.  His 
wife was contacted by phone and informed that he had eloped 
against medical advice.  She was instructed to send him back to 
the ER.  The wife was informed of the patient's abnormal CT 
findings and the need for a follow up head MRI in the future.

HCV: The patient's viral load was obtained and his transaminitis 
was thought to be secondary to Etoh abuse.  A RUQ US was also 
obtained which showed no gross lesions.  he will need GI follow 
up in the future.

life 2.  during this time  photo therapy was discontinued
and then restarted day bili ~11+. PhotoRx finally discontinued
d11 ([**3366-9-18**]). Rebound bili=7.7 on Friday, [**3366-9-19**].
Hematology: Hematocrit and platelet count on admission to NICU,
hematocrit 39.2%, platelet count of 222,000.  The infant's blood
type was not done since she has not required a blood transfusion.
Infectious disease:  Blood culture and CBC with differential
obtained on admission.  Initial white count was 14.2K with 46
polys and 0 bands.  The infant received 48 hours of
Ampicillin and gentamicin.  Blood culture has remained
negative to date.

***Endocrinology:  The infant has been followed by [**Hospital1 **]
endocrinologist (Fellow: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9161**] [**Name (STitle) 9162**]; Attending: Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2317**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].)
Thyroid studies have been performed and had initial TSI of 275 on
day of life 1 and repeat TSI of 195 on day of life 2.
Initial T4 was 3.7 with a free T4 of 0.6 and a TSH of 2.4 on day
of life 2.  Repeat studies showed on day of life 3, a T4 of 3.3
with a TSH of 2.8.  Current thyroid studies of T4 of 8.9 and
TSH of 0.098 on day of life 8.  Infant had a T3 uptake of
0.99 and a T4 index of 8.8 on day of life 9.  [**Hospital1 **]
endocrine recommend following thyroid function tests
q.weekly. [**3366-9-18**] TFS are as follows: T4=10, TSH=0.0333,
T3=107; T3 uptake=1.05. Infant is clinically stable.
Discussed transfer to [**Hospital1 9479**] NICU. Endocrine requested repeat same
TFS (as those performed [**3366-9-18**]) on Monday [**9-15**].

CARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS:  Feed at transfer is breast milk 24
made with 4 of HMS or Enfamil premature at 24 cals with a
total volume fluid of 150 mL/kg per day.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Iron supplementation is recommended for preterm and low
    birth weight infant until 12 months corrected age.
2. All infants who are fed predominantly breast milk should
    receive vitamin D supplementation at 200 IU (provided as
    a multivitamin preparation) daily until 12 months
    corrected age.

Car seat position screening is recommended prior to discharge
home.  State newborn screening sent for protocol.  Results on
[**3366-9-10**] showed TSH of 3.9 and a T4 of 3.5.  Repeat
state newborn screen is sent prior to transfer.

IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  Infant has not received
immunizations.

IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:
1. Synergist RSV prophylaxis to be considered from November
    through March for infants who meet the following 4
    criteria:

This was a diamniotic dichorionic twin pregnancy. The mother
was admitted in labor. Rupture of membranes occurred 11 hours
prior to delivery. There was no maternal fever. She received
multiple doses of penicillin prior to progression to
spontaneous vaginal delivery. This infant was noted to have a
nuchal cord that was cut at the perineum. She emerged
vigorous with spontaneous respirations and cry. Apgars were
9 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. She was admitted to the
neonatal intensive care unit for treatment of prematurity.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:
1.  Respiratory. [**Doctor First Name 6105**] has been in room air for her entire
    neonatal intensive care unit admission. We have not
    observed any episodes of spontaneous apnea. At the time
    of discharge, she is breathing comfortably in room air
    with a respiratory rate of 20-40 breaths per minute.
2.  Cardiovascular. [**Doctor First Name 6105**] required a normal saline bolus
    shortly after admission to the neonatal intensive care
    unit for poor perfusion. She has maintained normal heart
    rates and blood pressures since that time. No murmurs
    have been noted. Baseline heart rate is 110-140 beats per
    minute with a recent blood pressure of 73/45 mmHg, mean
    arterial pressure of 54 mmHg.
3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition. [**Doctor First Name 6105**] was started on
    ad lib p.o. feeds on the day of birth. She initially was
    slow to p.o. feed requiring gavage feedings. For the 48
    hours prior to discharge, she has been all p.o. feeding
    with a minimum of 80 mL/kg per day.
4.  Infectious disease. Due to her prematurity, [**Doctor First Name 6105**] was
    evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the neonatal
    intensive care unit. A complete blood count was within
    normal limits. A blood culture was obtained and there was
    no growth at 48 hours. She was not treated with
    antibiotics.
5.  Gastrointestinal. Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day of
    life #4, total 11.4 mg/dL. She was not treated with
    phototherapy. Bilirubin on the day of discharge is 13.6/0.4.
6.  Hematologic. Hematocrit at birth was 37%. Repeat
    hematocrit on day of life 3 was 40.6%. She did not
    receive any transfusions or blood products.
7.  Neurology. [**Doctor First Name 6105**] has maintained a normal neurological
    exam d[**MD Number 149**] admission. There are no neurological concerns
    at the time of discharge.
8.  Sensory/audiology. Hearing screening was performed with
    automated auditory brainstem responses. [**Doctor First Name 6105**] passed in
    both ears on [**3063-7-30**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with the parents.

CARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1.  Feeding. Ad lib feeding, breast milk or Similac 20
    calorie per ounce formula.
2.  No medications.
3.  Iron and vitamin D supplementation: Iron supplementation
    is recommended for preterm and low birth weight infants
    until 12 months corrected age. All infants that fed
    predominately breast milk should receive vitamin D
    supplementation at 200 international units (may be
    provided as a multivitamin preparation) daily until 12
    months corrected age.
4.  Car seat position screening was performed. [**Doctor First Name 6105**] was
    evaluated in her car seat for 90 minutes without any
    episodes of spontaneous apnea or oxygen desaturation.
5.  State newborn screen was sent on [**3063-7-30**]. No
    notification of abnormal results to date.
6.  Immunizations: Hepatitis B vaccine was administered on
    [**3063-7-28**].
7.  Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should
    be considered from November through March for infants who
    meet any of the following 4 criteria: First, born at less
    than 32 weeks; second, born between 32-35 weeks with 2 of
    the following: Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the
    household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities,
    or school age siblings; thirdly, chronic lung disease; or
    fourth hemodynamically significant congenital heart
    disease. Influenza immunization is recommended annually
    in the fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of
    age. Before this age and for the first 24 months of the

Date of Birth:  [**3212-7-28**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known patient lastname 10248**] presented to
the NICU as a 1 day old, term infant, who was referred from
the newborn nursery for evaluation of twitching movements
and reduced tone. She was born the day prior weighing 4155
grams.  She is the product of a 39 and 2/7 weeks gestation
pregnancy, born to a 29 year-old, G2, P1 now 2 mother, with
an estimated date of confinement of [**3212-8-2**].

Prenatal labs included blood type A positive, antibody
negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, HBSAG negative,
GBS negative.

This pregnancy was reportedly uncomplicated with normal mid
trimester ultrasound and normal serum triple screen.  Fetus
was known to be relatively macrosomic but the maternal glucose
tolerance test, GTT, was reassuring.  The infant was born via
repeat Cesarean section after mother presented the day of
delivery in labor. Delivery was scheduled for 7/11/1007.  No
sepsis risk factors were noted and the mother did not receive
intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.  Anesthesia was combined
spinal and epidural with high range of narcotic dose used,
due to difficulty with prior delivery.

At delivery, the infant emerged with Apgars of 7 and 8 with
no notable resuscitation needed. Infant was initially
admitted to the regular nursery.  Vital signs remained stable
although the infant required warming twice for mild
hypothermia with normal dextro-sticks, between 45 and 60.
There was mild work of breathing noted initially that
gradually improved and the infant breast fed several times
without significant difficulty. However, the infant was noted
throughout the night to have frequent twitching movements of
the extremities as well as facial twitches. The infant was
also thought to be hypotonic and although responsive, did not
develop a vigorous cry. The infant was seen by the neonatal
nurse practitioner the first evening and thought to appear
otherwise stable but due to persistent concerns, the infant
was transferred to the NICU on [**3212-7-29**].

Family history is unremarkable. There is no history of
unusual neonatal illnesses. Mother is otherwise healthy with
no ongoing medical problems and no medication use. Mother
denies [**Name2 (NI) 9651**] and other drugs of abuse. Maternal obstetric
history is notable for prior Cesarean section at term, due to
failure to progress but with otherwise uncomplicated
pregnancy and neonatal course. That child is now 2 years old
and healthy.

Social history is otherwise unremarkable.

At birth, the infant's weight was 4155 grams and is in the
greater than 90th percentile.  Head circumference 37.5 cm,
greater than 90th percentile.  Length 51.5 cm, 75th to 90th
percentile.  Physical exam at discharge: Weight 4290 gms, L 59
cms, HC 39 cms.  Resting comfortably in mother's arms.
Responded to exam and opened eyes. Non-dysmorphic. AFSF. RR
x2.  Normal set ears. Palate slightly high, rhythmic suck.
Neck supple. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. CV
RRR, no murmur, 2+femoral/peripheral pulses. Abd soft, +BS.

patent anus. no sacral anomalies. Neuro: Decreased tone and
strength. Especially with truncal hypotonia. Significant head
lag. Reflexes: No to minim [**Doctor Last Name **] planter, grasp, Galant and Moro
reflexes. Suck does appear str [**Last Name (un) **] and coordinated. Sporadic,
multifocal myoclonus of face/limbs/eyelids.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  
     
Respiratory: The infant was initially in room air while in
the NICU.  She was noted to have dusky episodes, some with
apnea and some with just desaturations and bradycardia.
Some of these events required blow-by oxygen and stimulation.
These cardiorespiratory events do persist and vary from day
to day.

The infant was placed on nasal cannula oxygen due to frequent
drifting in oxygen saturations on [**3212-8-6**]. She has remained
on nasal cannula at 50 to 75 cc flow and 100% and continues to
have occasional events as described above. Now most are quick
and self-resolved.

Cardiovascular:  Outside of the bradycardic events mentioned
above, [**Known patient lastname 4923**] has maintained cardiovascular stability with
no murmurs, normal baseline heart rates and normal blood
pressures.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  She was made n.p.o. on
admission to the NICU and IV fluids were initiated.   She was
started on enteral feedings on [**3212-7-30**] and allowed to ad lib
breast feed again at that time. The infant did require the
initiation of gavage feedings as the enteral feedings were
advanced due to poor p.o. abilities.  Currently, her po
intakes vary while bottling taking in ~ [**10/3165**] mL at a time of
approximately 106 mL q4 volume.  She reportedly will also
vary at the breast, feeding for approximately 5 to 20 minutes
at a time.  The plan for discharge is to offer ad lib p.o.
feedings by breast at home. The most recent weight is 4290
grams on [**3212-8-22**]. The infant has been growing well while in
the NICU.

Gastrointestinal:  The infant had mild hyperbilirubinemia
with a peak bilirubin level of 15.2 over 0.3 on [**3212-8-7**],
day of life 10. The infant required no phototherapy and the
bilirubin level resolved with the most recent bilirubin level
of 12.8 over 0.5 on [**3212-8-10**].

Hematology:  No blood typing has been done on this infant.
Hematocrit at birth was 51.8 with a platelet count of 383.

Infectious disease: Due to the neurologic symptomatology, a
CBC and blood culture were screened on admission to the NICU.
The CBC was within normal limits with a white blood cell
count of 25.9 white, 64 polys, 4 bands, 22 lymphs. Blood
culture was drawn at that time. Antibiotics were not
initiated. The blood culture remained negative at 48 hours.
The infant has required no antibiotic therapy. There have
been no further issues of infectious disease.

Neurology:  Neurology consult was initiated on [**3212-7-29**] due
to the neurologic symptomatology.  An extensive evaluation has
been performed with the following tests and results:
   1.  A CAT scan was done on [**3212-7-29**] which showed no
       hemorrhage.
   2.  An EEG was done on [**3212-7-30**] which showed no seizures but
       discontinuous background.  A repeat EEG was done on
       [**3212-8-6**] and showed subtle changes with a more
       continuous background but with continued excessive
       bitemporal spikes.   
   3.  A MRI done on [**3212-7-31**] showed a dysgenic brain -
       cerebral underdevelopment, underdevelopment of the
       anterior operculum, and simplified frontal gyria
       (bitemporal perisylvian/ bifrontal polymicrogyria-
       pachygyria)
   4.  A lactate on [**3212-7-30**] was 2.3.  
   5.  Serum pyruvate on [**3212-7-30**] was 0.18.  
   6.  Glucose 61 on [**3212-7-30**].  
   7.  Liver function tests were done on [**3212-7-31**]. The ALT
       was 7, AST 22, CPK 169, alkaline phosphatase 111,
   8.  Ammonia on [**3212-7-30**] was 52, and 63 on [**3212-8-3**].
   9.  Arterial blood gases were within normal limits.  
   10. State screen was normal on [**3212-7-30**].  
   11. Uric acid on [**3212-8-7**] was 1.6 which is low.  This
       could represent a Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency.  Urine
       thosulfate levels are pending.
   12. Acetyl carnitine profile on [**3212-8-10**] was normal.  
   13. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was sent on [**3212-7-30**]. The
       cell count was normal with a white blood cell count of
       2 and one red blood cell with a normal differential.
       Glucose of 31, protein 85, lactate 12.5, pyruvate 0.3,
       amino acids normal.
   14. Neuro transmitter metabolites were sent from the CSF on
       [**3212-7-31**] and those were normal.  
   15. Urine toxicology was normal on [**3212-7-29**].  
   16. Urine for organic acids on [**3212-7-30**] were normal.  
   17. Pending studies:
       Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) on [**3212-8-10**]
       Pipecolic acid on [**3212-8-10**]
       Urine thiosulfate 
       Urine mucopolysaccharides
       Urine oligosaccharides were all sent on [**3212-8-7**]. 

The infant had a 3 day trial of PO Pyridoxine (100mg) which
did not change her neurological exam and presentation.

The infant has been followed closely by [**Hospital3 27**]
neurology service, Attending-Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4649**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4650**], telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10249**].  The infant has a diagnosis of early myoclonic
encephalopathy of unknown origin. The prognosis is poor per
neurology with limited life-span, intractable seizures, and
significant cognitive and motor deficits. It has been offered
to the parents to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4649**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4650**] in the
Neonatal Neurology [**Hospital 202**] clinic either with [**Known patient lastname 4923**] or
just as a couple to discuss pending test results, potential
autospy results when available, and significance of
[**Known patient lastname 10250**] condition for future pregnancies.

Genetics:  A genetics consult was done on [**3212-7-30**] to rule
out a genetic abnormality.  Chromosomes were sent and the
chromosomes came back as normal, 46XX. No further genetic
evaluations have been recommended.

Sensory: Audiology: Hearing screen was performed with
automated auditory brain stem responses and the infant
referred in both ears on [**3212-8-5**].  Ophthalmology:  No eye
exams have been done on this infant.

Psychosocial:  A [**Hospital1 160**] social worker, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 316**] [**Doctor Last Name 318**], has
been in contact with the family.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Guarded.
 
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with the parents under Hospice
Care and with a DNR order.

There have been numerous family meetings and team meetings
with the parents and with members from the NICU team, social
work, neurology consultants, and with the Palliative Care Team
(PACT) from [**Hospital3 27**].  Given the severity of
[**Known patient lastname 10250**] diagnosis the plan agreed upon by all members of
the team and [**Known patient lastname 10250**] parents is to discharge her to home
with her parents and to provide comfort care measures only.
