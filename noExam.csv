Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


The patient was admitted on [**2544-2-6**], status post
left hemithyroidectomy for presumed adenoma. Please see
operative dictation. The patient was unable to be intubated
after multiple attempts by 2 senior anesthesiologists and
then finally failed fiberoptic intubation. For this reason,
the case was done via LMA. At the conclusion of the case,
there was some hypoxia and postoperative significant
atelectasis as the patient had been taking large volume tidal
volumes throughout the entire case. For this reason, his
saturations remained persistently low in the mid 80s on
support with oxygen and he was transmitted over to BiPAP. At
this point in time, it was decided the patient should be
recruited overnight and was sent to the Finnard ICU for which
he would have recruitment maneuvers, meaning BiPAP overnight
in order to try and resolve the atelectasis that was at the
base of the lung.

On admission to the Finnard ICU, they removed the BiPAP and
wrote him for subcutaneous heparin. So he was unable to be
recruited overnight. He ended up being persistently hypoxic
on nasal prongs, so he ended up staying another 2 days,
finally resolved the atelectasis and was discharged in stable
condition saturating approximately 94% in room air.

In conclusion, the reason for the dictation is such that care
needs to be taken with this patient in regards to the fact
that he is a very difficult airway and difficult intubation
so any further procedures on this patient will certainly
involve preoperative planning as far as the airway goes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for high cholesterol, hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for left inguinal hernia
repair.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 81 mg, atenolol 12.5 daily, Lipitor 10,
Protonix 40.

ALLERGIES:  He has no allergies.

The patient was discharged in stable condition and will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks time for review of
pathology. The patient was discharged on pain medications,
stool softener and was given guaifenesin and an albuterol
inhaler.

Service:  NB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] [**Known patient lastname 3366**] is a 32 [**2-8**] week
infant admitted to the NICU with prematurity in respiratory
distress.

He was born at 5:51 AM on the morning on [**3419-2-19**], as
the 1775 gram product of a 32 [**2-8**] week gestation. Mother was
a 32 -year-old G2, P1-2 woman with estimated date of
conception of [**3419-4-13**], as determined by an early
ultrasound. Pregnancy was unremarkable until approximately 2
days prior to delivery when mother developed low back pain.
The night prior to delivery the back pain increased
progressing to labor. Mother presented in advanced labor with
spontaneous rupture of membranes at 5:47 AM and spontaneous
vaginal delivery several minutes later. No maternal fever or
other risk factors for sepsis were noted and mother did not
receive interpartum antibiotics or analgesia. Mother's blood
type is 0 negative. Other prenatal laboratory studies were
not available at the time of initial admission, however,
returned later as negative. 
     
At delivery infant emerged vigorous with spontaneous
respiratory effort requiring nonrebreather by O2. Apgar's
were 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes of age. He was
brought to the NICU. In the NICU moderate grunting and
retractions were noted and the infant was placed on CPAP.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight was 1775 which is the
50th percentile, length 41.5 cm which is the 25th percentile,
head circumference of 29.5 which is the 25th percentile to
50th percentile, temperature 98.4, heart rate 170,
respiratory rate 40, blood pressure 72/38 with a mean blood
pressure of 48, oxygen saturation of 98 to 100% on blow-by
O2. In general, he was an active vigorous infant in moderate
respiratory distress. The skin was warm and pink with no
rashes or bruises. HEENT examination revealed anterior
fontanelles which were soft and flat with mild molding and
intact palate and ears and nares patent. Lung examination
revealed poor to moderate aeration, coarse symmetric breath
sounds, moderate grunting and retractions. Cardiovascular
examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with no murmur
or gallop. Abdominal examination was soft with no
hepatosplenomegaly or 3-vessel cord, no masses and quiet
bowel sounds. GU exam revealed a normal premature male with
testes descended bilaterally and anus patent. Extremities
revealed no lesions and no edema. Hips and back were normal,
and he had appropriate tone activity for age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory - The patient
remained on CPAP until day of life #1 when he was
transitioned to room air and he has been on room air ever
since, maintaining good oxygen saturation. The patient never
required caffeine for the treatment of apnea of prematurity.
He had occasional desaturations most frequently with feed.
The last desaturation was 5 days prior to discharge which
also occurred with feeding.

Cardiovascular - The patient remained hemodynamically stable
throughout his admission with no murmur noted on examination,
and blood pressures within normal limits.

FEN - [**Known patient lastname 3367**] was initially n.p.o. on total fluids of 80
cc/kg/day. On day of life #2 he was allowed to begin feeding
and was slowly advanced to full feeds by day of life #5.
[**Known patient lastname 3367**] is currently feeding breast milk concentrate to 24
cal/oz with Similac powder, weight at discharge is 2580
grams, birthweight was 1775 grams. The patient showed good
growth and development since admission.

GI - [**Known patient lastname 3367**] was started on single phototherapy on day of
life #3 for a bilirubin of 10.7/0.4. Phototherapy was
discontinued on day of life #3 and rebound bilirubin was
6.5/0.2. The patient has remained without any further GI
issues since that time.

Heme - The patient had an initial hematocrit of 61. [**Known patient lastname 3367**]
was started on iron on day of life #5 and is discharged on
iron at 0.4 cc daily.

Infectious disease - Due to premature labor CBC and blood
cultures were obtained on admission and [**Known patient lastname 3367**] was started
on ampicillin and gentamicin. Initial CBC was benign with a
white count of 17 with 18 polys and 1 band. Antibiotics were
stopped at 48 hours when blood cultures returned negative.
The patient was noted to have eye drainage on day of life #24
and was started on erythromycin after culture was obtained.
Subsequently culture became positive for Staph aureus
resistant to erythromycin but sensitive to gentamicin and
therefore on day of life #28 the patient was switched to
gentamicin and continues to have drainage of his left eye.
However, his right eye is looking much better.

Neuro - Head ultrasound was not indicated.

Sensory - Hearing screening was performed and he passed in
both ears.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To home.

PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3368**] [**Name (STitle) 3369**], phone #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3370**].

CARE/RECOMMENDATIONS:  Feeds at discharge are breast milk
concentrated to 24 cal/oz with Similac powder.

Medications the patient will go home on are ferrous sulfate
0.4 cc daily as well as Vi-Daylin 1 cc daily.

State newborn screening was sent on [**3419-2-23**], and
repeat state screening was sent on [**3419-3-7**].

Immunizations received; the patient did receive hepatitis B
on admission due to unknown maternal hepatitis B status,
however, at that time [**Known patient lastname 3367**] was less than 2 kg and
therefore received subsequent hepatitis B vaccine on day of
life #28 which will be considered his first hepatitis B
vaccination.

1.  Prematurity at 32 3/7 weeks.  
2.  Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.  
3.  Rule out sepsis, resolved.  
4.  Hyperbilirubinemia, resolved.  
5.  Conjunctivitis.

ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 12631**] is a 73 year-old
male who initially presented to an outside hospital with a
painless jaundice and a CA199 of 665 at which time he
underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography,
which was thought to be consistent with a ________ tumor and
had a sphincterotomy and plastic stent placed with brushings
at the time, which demonstrated atypical cells consistent
with cholangiocarcinoma.  He underwent CT scan, which did not
show visible lesions and subsequently underwent removal of
the plastic stent and the PTC.  Given his diagnosis he was
referred for surgical management to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the
Hepatobiliary Service.  At the time of his admission and
prior to the surgery his total bilirubin was 2.3 with a
direct of 1.5 and an indirect of 1.8, alkaline phosphatase
263 and his ALT and AST were 55 and 56 respectively.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2969-3-2**] and on that same day underwent cholecystectomy with a
common duct excision and a left hepatic lobectomy and a
pylorus sparing Whipple.  Intraoperatively there was noted to
be a great deal of inflammation desmol plastic reaction in
the porta hepatis and a mass at the confluence of the right
and left hepatic ducts.  There was no note of excessive
intraoperative blood loss and the patient tolerated the
procedure well and was taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit
in stable condition postoperatively from which he was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  In terms of his
hospital course from a neurological point of view the patient
had no significant issues.  His pain was initially controlled
with an epidural, which was managed by the Acute Pain
Service.  This was weaned secondary to episodes of
hypotension after which time narcotics such as morphine were
used prn for sedation and pain control.  From a respiratory
standpoint the patient remained intubated postoperatively for
respiratory support, but the patient was planned to wean from
to extubation on postoperative day five, but remained
extubated secondary to complication of bleeding for which he
was taken back to the Operating Room.  He was subsequently
extubated on postoperative day three after the second
procedure.  He did notably develop some pleural effusions
postoperatively, but these were improving prior to discharge.

From a cardiac standpoint the patient did fairly well and had
no noted events of ischemia.  From a gastrointestinal
standpoint the patient's course was relatively complicated.
The final pathology from the surgery did reveal that he did
have metastatic adenocarcinoma involving the lymph[**MD Number 112**] and
biliary ducts as noted.  Given the extent of the surgery the
patient did have drains, which remained postoperatively for
bile drainage.  The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay was
notable for aggressive diuresis with Lasix secondary to large
amounts of fluid he received in the immediate perioperative
period.  Electrolytes were repleted as needed.  From a
nutrition standpoint the patient was started on total
parenteral nutrition in the immediate postoperative period.
By the time of discharge his total parenteral nutrition was
discontinued two days prior to discharge as he had adequate
po intake and regular diet and Boost supplement shakes.  From
a renal standpoint the patient's initial creatinine remained
around 1.0 with slight variations, but was noted during the
last week of his hospitalization to be slightly elevated and
prior to discharge his creatinine was 1.4 with a BUN of 40.
There were no overt episodes of acute renal failure, although
he did have some oliguria in the Intensive Care Unit for
which he required albumin.  Notably the patient did have a G
tube cholangiogram to evaluate for a leak via the T tube.
There was no evidence of leak and the intrahepatic right bile
duct looked normal.

Hematologically as noted above the patient did have an
episode of hypotension postoperatively along with a
significant amount of a sanguinous output from his JP drain
at which time he was taken back to the Operating Room and
reexplored and found to have a bleeding vessel, which was
then suture ligated.  He was transfused as needed and by the
time of discharge his hematocrit had been stable between 34
and 35.  From an infectious disease standpoint the patient
was given broad spectrum antibiotic coverage postoperatively
with Unasyn.  In terms of his culture data his peritoneal
fluid did grow out some [**Female First Name (un) **], otherwise he did have one
set of blood cultures, which showed coag negative staph.
Biliary fluid did grow E-coli.  Given these culture findings
he was treated with Vanco, Zosyn and Ambazone starting on
postoperative days six and two.  After a two week course of
the previously mentioned broad spectrum antibiotics he was
switched over to Ciprofloxacin on postoperative days 21 and
17 for cholangitis prophylaxis.  Blood cultures drawn prior
to his discharge were all negative.

In terms of laboratories prior to discharge his white blood
cell count was 19.2 and was somewhat elevated, but the
patient had been afebrile and no focal source of infection
was noted.  His hematocrit was 35.  His platelet count was
180, INR 1.3 with a PT of 138.  Otherwise his BUN and
creatinine were 40 and 1.4, K was 4.2.  In terms of liver
function tests his ALT and AST were 136 and 186 with an
alkaline phosphatase of 237 and a total bilirubin of 10.0.
His albumin was 2.8.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po q.d. until follow up in one week.
2.  Reglan 10 mg po q.i.d. a.c.h.s.
3.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
4.  Pancrease two caplets po t.i.d. with meals.
5.  Boost shakes two po b.i.d.

He was discharged with VNA nursing for daily weights, Boost
shakes and he would have repeat laboratory testing and follow
up in the Hepatobiliary Clinic in one week.

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old
gentleman who is status post inferior wall MI on [**2579-9-10**].
At that time, he underwent a PTCA stent to his RCA.  At the
time of his cardiac catheterization, it was noted that he had
multiple LAD and LCX lesions.  It was elected to discharge
the patient to home and have the patient come back to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory at a later date for
treatment of those lesions.  The patient was admitted on
[**2579-10-19**] for repeat cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Type 2 diabetes, now insulin-dependent.
4.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction.
5.  Status post kidney surgery, type unknown, as a child.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Zestril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  NPH insulin 18 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
8.  Humalog sliding scale.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for a hematocrit
of 40.7, potassium 4.5, BUN 18, creatinine 0.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory on [**2579-10-19**] where he was started
on an Integrelin infusion and given a heparin bolus.  During
the cardiac catheterization, an attempted PCI of the LAD was
undertaken.  During the PCI, the patient began to develop
chest pain and ST segment elevations.  There was no flow
through the LAD and no improvement in the flow with
vasodilators.  Due to the patient's continued chest pain, an
intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted in the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory and the patient was taken
emergently to the Operating Room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 167**] for coronary
artery bypass.

In the Operating Room, the patient underwent a CABG times
three with SVG to LAD, SVG to diagonal, and SVG to OM.  Due
to the patient's coagulation status preoperatively with the
patient being on Plavix and Integrelin, the patient had a
large amount of chest tube output in the Operating Room and
postoperatively.  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit on a large amount of pressors due to a
low blood pressure.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had approximately 2
liters of chest tube drainage in the first hour in the
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was quickly taken back to
the Operating Room.  In the Operating Room, there were found
only small areas of bleeding which were repaired.  The
patient's coagulopathy was corrected and the patient was
again transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit on
epinephrine and Amiodarone in stable condition.  Please see
the operative note for further details.

On the evening of postoperative day number one, the patient
required large amounts of blood products.  The patient
continued on his intra-aortic balloon pump.  It was elected
to keep the patient intubated on the night of postoperative
day number one.  The patient's chest tube output was
considerably decreased.  The patient was moderately hypoxic.
The chest x-ray showed volume overload.

By postoperative day number two, the patient's coagulopathy
had been corrected and he was hemodynamically stable.  The
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed without complications.
The patient required large amounts of diuresis over the next
several days for the patient's oxygenation and enable the
patient to wean on the ventilator.

On postoperative day number three, it was noted that the
patient had a large right-sided pleural effusion.  A right
pleural chest tube was inserted with 1,500 cc of old dark
blood and improvement in the patient's chest x-ray.  After
the chest tube was inserted, the patient began complaining of
the sensation of shortness of breath and became tachypneic.
A repeat chest x-ray was performed which showed no
pneumothorax, no effusion; however, the patient's
endotracheal tube was noted to be high.  This was advanced.
However, the patient continued to remain anxious.  The
patient's oxygenation improved with sedation.

By postoperative day number four, the patient had been weaned
off of his pressors and was started on a low-dose beta
blocker.  The patient was noted to have a dropping platelet
count.  A heparin antibody test was sent which was
subsequently negative.  The patient had been started on
Plavix as he still had a stent to his RCA.  It was
recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 167**] that the patient be transfused
platelets and given Plavix as the concern for keeping the
stent patent.

On the evening of postoperative day number four, the patient
began draining large amounts of bloody fluid from his sternal
incision which was thought to be a liquefying hematoma.  On
postoperative day number five, the patient continued to have
a large amount of drainage and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 167**] decided to return
the patient to the Operating Room for tightening of the
sternal wires as he thought the drainage was due to a sternal
dehiscence.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and
returned to the Intensive Care Unit and remained intubated
throughout.

On the evening of postoperative day number five, the patient
was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation and
required vigorous chest PT to maintain oxygen saturation, had
a moderate productive cough.  It was also noted on the
evening of postoperative day number five that the patient had
icteric sclerae.  A bilirubin was sent which was noted to be
elevated at 6.8.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained on
postoperative day number eight which showed evidence of
increased echogenicity consistent with fatty infiltration of
the liver.  No focal liver lesions.  No evidence of
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation,
common bile duct normal in size, unremarkable gallbladder
without stones.  Limited view of the pancreas due to
overlying bowel gas.

The patient continued on IV vancomycin prophylactically for
the multiple reoperations and the sternal drainage.  The
patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the
floor on postoperative day number seven.  The patient was
again noted to have a moderate amount of serosanguinous
drainage from the sternal incision as well as a moderate
amount of drainage from his right lower extremity vein
harvest site.

On postoperative day number nine, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 167**] evaluated the
patient and applied Dermabond to the sternal incision;
however, on postoperative day number ten, the patient
continued to drain serosanguinous fluid from his incisions.
It was decided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 167**] that the patient would return to
the Operating Room for sternal rewiring.  At this time, the
patient had begun complaining of nausea and abdominal pain.
The patient was noted to have elevated amylase and lipase.
The patient was changed to clear liquids and made n.p.o. for
the Operating Room.

The patient's Operating Room was delayed due to scheduling.
On the evening of postoperative day number nine, the
patient's sternal drainage became very minimal so it was
elected to delay surgery.  With the patient becoming n.p.o.,
the patient's amylase and lipase were decreased.  The patient
continued to be n.p.o. and subsequently his nausea and left
upper quadrant pain subsided.  His amylase and lipase
continued to decrease.  His sternal incision drainage
decreased to nothing.  The patient continued on his
vancomycin.

On postoperative day number 14, the patient's amylase and
lipase had decreased sufficiently.  The patient had tolerated
clear liquids.  The patient was started on a regular diet.
On the night of postoperative day number 14, after one meal,
the patient had again elevated amylase and lipase.  The
patient was switched to a low-fat diet and the patient's
amylase and lipase continued to trend down.  The patient's
sternal drainage had stopped and by postoperative day number
16, the patient was cleared for discharge to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post emergent coronary artery bypass graft.
3.  Status post reoperation for bleeding.
4.  Postoperative sternal drainage.
5.  Status post sternal rewire for sternal dehiscence.
6.  Postoperative pancreatitis.
7.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  T maximum 98.6, pulse 90, sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 106/60, respiratory rate 14, room air
oxygen saturation 96%.  The patient was awake, alert,
oriented times three, ambulating independently with a
nonfocal neurological examination.  The heart revealed a
regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.  The lungs
were clear bilaterally.  The abdomen was with positive bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  He was tolerating a
low-fat diet.  He had no nausea or vomiting.  He was having
regular bowel movements.  The sternal incision showed peeling
Dermabond.  No drainage.  No erythema.  The sternum was
stable.  The right lower extremity showed resolving
ecchymosis with a small amount of serosanguinous drainage
from the medial knee and a small amount of resolving erythema
at the distal incision right above the ankle.

Date of Birth:   [**3008-1-28**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEONATOLOGY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby girl [**Known patient lastname 3064**] [**Known patient lastname 588**] II was
born at 24 and 5/7 weeks gestation, triplet number two of
this spontaneously conceived triplet pregnancy.  This
pregnancy was complicated by twin to twin transfusion between
this baby and baby number three who shared a placenta.  The
hypertension and its worsening prompted the delivery via
cesarean section.  The mother is a 27 year-old gravida 2 para
1 now 4 woman.  Her blood type is O positive, antibody
negative, Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis surface
antigen negative, group B strep unknown.  This infant emerged
weighing 365 grams and she was active and vigorous at the
time of delivery.  Her Apgars were 6 at one minute and 7 at
Delivery Room.  She has remained critically ill with
both severe lung disease and intraabdominal free air and she
expired on
[**2-3**] at 10:05 p.m.  This evening at approximately 9:30
she had an acute episode of desaturation and bradycardia.
Her endotracheal tube position was confirmed and no further
intervention was undertaken.  She continued to receive her
current pressor support and pain management at the time, but
due to previous discussions with the family asking that we do
not intervene in the event of an acute event, no further
intervention was taken.  The parents were notified.  The
infant expired approximately 35 minutes later and the father
arrived approximately 25 minutes after that.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Her admission physical examination revealed
a symmetrically growth restricted infant.  Her skin was thin
and friable.  Anterior fontanel open and flat.  Her eyelids
were both fused.  Her palate was intact.  Coarse tight breath
sounds with deep retractions were present.  Breath sounds
were coarse throughout, but equal.  She had normal S1 and S2
heart sounds.  No murmur.  She had a three vessel umbilical
cord.  Abdomen was soft.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Preterm
female external genitalia.  Patent anus.  Negative spinal
examination.  Age appropriate tone and reflexes.

Respiratory status, after increasing support was required on
conventional ventilation she was transitioned to high
frequency ventilation and she remained there until day of
life number five when she transitioned back to conventional
ventilation.

Cardiovascular status, after receiving some volume
resuscitation she required pressor support up to a maximum of
20 micrograms per kilogram per minute of Dopamine.  At the
time of death she was receiving approximately 11 mics per
kilo per minute of Dopamine.

On day of life number three she was begun on a three dose
course of Indomethacin for a clinical presentation of patent
ductus arteriosus and that course was completed on day of
life number four.

Fluid, electrolyte and nutrition status, she had an umbilical
arterial and an arterial venous catheter place.  She was
receiving parental nutrition.  She initially had some
hypoglycemia that resolved with dextrose boluses and remained
euglycemic after that time.  Her last set of electrolytes on
[**3008-2-3**] was a sodium 129, potassium 3.1, chloride 100 and
bicarbonate 21.  Her last blood glucose was 108.

Gastrointestinal status, she was being treated with
phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity.  Her peak
bilirubin on day of life number two was total 2.6, direct
0.4.  On day of life number four she had progressive
distention of her abdomen and an abdominal x-ray at that time
showed free peritoneal air.  A surgical consult was
undertaken and in discussions with the family, surgical and
NICU teams it was felt that the risks associated with
exploratory laparotomy or drain palcement did not result in a
situation in which operation would be pursued.  She continued to
have bowel rest with
gastric decompression.

Hematological status, her platelets at the time of admission
were 72,000.  They reached a low of 49,000 on day of life
four.  She received transfusion of platelets.  Her last
platelet count was 145,000.  She also received transfusion of
packed white blood cells.  Her lowest hematocrit was 28 on
day of life number three and her hematocrit on the day that
she died was 33.9.

Infectious disease, she was started on Ampicillin and
Gentamycin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors
and had planned to receive a seven day course of the
antibiotics.  Clindamycin was added on day of life number
four when an intestinal perforation was present on x-ray.

Neurological status, a head ultrasound on day of life number
one was within normal status and repeated on [**3008-2-2**] again
completely within normal limits.  She was receiving Fentanyl
for pain management.

Social status, the parents have been very involved in the
infant's care and had received extensive counseling prior to
the birth of these three infants.  They were very involved,
had many questions and were very clear about their wishes for
the infant throughout the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay.

They had not yet determined who a primary pediatric provider
would have been.

Family notified regarding death.

Admission Date:  [**3202-11-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**3202-11-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**3161-12-18**]     Sex:  F

Service:  INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Short gut syndrome, chronically
occluded superior vena cava, right brachiocephalic vein and
right jugular vein, occlusion of the inferior vena cava and
both common iliac veins, TPN dependent.

polyposis, she had resection of her colon at age 20 and now
has a high output ileostomy.  She is dependent on TPN
although she can take small amounts of oral food.  Over the
years, she has chronically occluded both internal jugular
veins, both subclavian veins and the upper segment of the
superior vena cava.  She came in [**3201-9-29**], to our
attention when she had developed Staphylococcus aureus sepsis
At this time, we removed a tunneled femoral catheter which
had been tunneled from the right groin into the left upper
chest and placed temporary access.  After clearing of the
infection, we were attempting to recanalize the occluded
central veins but were unsuccessful, even with a sharp
recanalization technique.  On [**3202-2-12**], I then decided to
place a new tunneled right femoral 7French double lumen
Hickman catheter with tip at the level of L1 and the exit
site over the lateral thigh.

The patient came to see on [**3202-11-11**], in clinic with the chief
complaint of line dysfunction.  She had noticed some
sluggishness of return during TPN infusions and then had
stopped TPN and only placed hydration.  She brought a
venogram from [**3202-10-30**], which demonstrated that the tip of
the catheter had pulled back into the distal inferior vena
cava. There was some high grade narrowing in both common
iliac veins which were still patent at this time.  The
inferior vena cava was not filled and there were paralumbar
collaterals.

On [**3202-11-15**], she was admitted to St. [**Hospital **] Medical Center
in [**Hospital1 **], [**State **] for line sepsis, generalized
weakness, near syncope and low grade fever.  She came to the
[**Hospital1 75**] on [**3202-11-19**].  She
presented in a severely debilitated status.  Her blood
pressure was 96/54, with a pulse rate of 123, temperature
100, and oxygen saturation 99%.  The catheter over the right
thigh had pulled back with the calf being outside of the
skin.  There was some swelling and induration over the right
thigh extending to the level of the knee which was suggestive
of deep venous thrombosis but additional superinfection and
cellulitis could not be ruled out.   The lungs were clear.
The abdomen was soft.  There was an intact left lower
quadrant ileostomy.  The heart rate was regular and
considering the rate, murmurs could not be elicited.

To assess her semi-obtunded status, blood was drawn which
revealed a severe hypomagnesemia with a level of 0.7 and a
hematocrit of 26.6.  She received an infusion of Magnesium.
Because of an antibody to the blood, blood was ordered but
couldn't be transfused before the start of the procedure. To
reduce further risks of sepsis due to the line, we proceeded
with recanalization of the inferior vena cava.  Because of
the patient's low pain threshold, all procedures had to be
performed under MAC anesthesia.  I removed the tunneled right
femoral line and replaced it with a 7French bright tip
sheath.  I also gained access through the left femoral vein.
It was possible to recanalize both iliac veins and the
chronically occluded inferior vena cava.  Infusion catheters
were placed and TPA was infused for the remainder of the day
and of the night.

On [**3202-11-20**], the patient returned to the angiography suite in
the morning.  Some interval lysis had occurred.  The TPA
infusion was continued until the afternoon.  In the meantime,
she had been transfused with two units of packed red blood
cells and her hematocrit had reached 30.0.  In the afternoon,
I was able to dilate the occluded inferior vena cava and
place kissing stents in the chronic occlusion channels of the
inferior vena cava.  Stents were also extended into both
common iliac veins and the adjacent segments of the external
iliac veins.  The patient was heparinized overnight.

The next morning a follow-up was done which demonstrated that
the left sided system was still open.  On the right side, a
separation between the caval and the iliac stent had occurred
and the inferior stent had moved slightly laterally.  The
main goal for this day's procedure was to give the patient
also a superior vena cava access since it became clear that
she would be having recurrent infections in the long run.
The main treatment goal was to provide for the future three
access sites: one for a tunneled line, one for a temporary line
should the permanent one become infected and needs pulling, and
a 3rd for a new tunneled line, considering this patient is life-
long tpn.
She was controlled with Vancomycin.  Her levels on the one
gram per day regimen was what she came from the outside
revealed a Vancomycin random level of 40. With input from
infectious diseases consult over the next days, appropriate
Vancomycin regimen was obtained.  On [**3202-11-21**], I then
undertook sharp recanalization of the superior vena cava
through a right internal jugular approach by placing a snare
into the superior vena cava as a target.  It was possible to
recanalize the internal jugular, brachiocephalic, and superior
vena cava with stents and  place a temporary double lumen
catheter.  In the same session, I also repaired the separated
caval stent by placing of an additional briding stent.
By the next morning, the patient remained heparinized.  She
had some oozing around the right neck exit site.  I had
removed the femoral access on the evening before to reduce
the overall risk of infection.  We had obtained cultures from
the tip of the previously indwelling tunneled catheter and
blood cultures were obtained.  There was no growth to date.
A regimen with one gram Vancomycin every eighteen hours was
then achieved with appropriate trough levels.  Ultimately,
the right internal jugular line was exchanged for a tunneled
7French double lumen Angiodynamics catheter of 57
centimeter length.  The tip was placed into the superior vena
cava.

In the following course, the patient had only low grade
temperature to 100, however, no spikes.  She was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 **] from the Intensive Care Unit on [**3202-11-26**].  On
[**3202-11-26**], she still had some swelling of her neck and both
arms which may have been related to fluid therapy.  An
ultrasound on [**3202-11-17**], demonstrated that the internal
jugular vein and superior vena cava were patent compatible
with a successful recanalization.  On [**3202-11-27**], the swelling
had been much reduced so that now there also was a satisfying
clinic result, and on [**11-28**] facies and arms were normal.

We had attempted to Coumadinize her since she had been on
Coumadin on the outside.  However, because of the unreliable
gastrointestinal absorption, we decided to add instead
greater amounts of Heparin to her TPN and her daily infusion
regimen.

Of note, her hematocrit drifted again down to 23.0% on
[**3202-11-26**].  This included a blood loss of about 250 cc for all
the surgical interventions.  We therefore transfused her
again with two units of packed red blood cells.

From an infectious disease point, she never expressed open
sepsis.  We will keep her on Vancomycin until [**3202-11-28**].  She
developed an oral herpes which was treated for five days with
Acyclovir.

The TPN is to be reinstituted with a nightly infusion. With
hematology consult we recommend to add folate and B12. B12 may
not be stable in TPN, so she may need addional injections.  We
drew folate and B12 levels today. results are pending. adapted
the composition to address the recurrent. Heparin in the TPN
infusion bag should be increased to 8000 U per day. The daily 1
L infusion of  D5-/2NS should be supplemented with 5000 U
heparin to be infused over the day. Additional fluid should not
contain heparin if need for hydration in presence of a high out
put ileostomy.  We also obtained hematology consultation to
address the issue of recurrent bouts of anemia which the
patient also had at home. This resulted in the B12 and folate
additon recommendation. We also drew today Ferritin, folate, B12
and reticulocyte counts. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3039**] will follow up with outpatient
consult. Recommend also bone density study because of prior
hysterectomy and heparin use as well as genetic cousneling
because of [**Doctor First Name 3040**] familial inbcidence of cancer to assess for
Li-Frameni BRCA.
On discharge, the patient is stable.  She has no signs of
acute infection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Short gut syndrome due to [**Location (un) 3041**] syndrome.
2.  Life long TPN dependent.
3.  Occlusion of the inferior vena cava and both common iliac
veins treated by stent reconstruction.
4.  Superior vena cava syndrome with occlusion of all central
veins treated by reconstruction of the right internal
jugular, brachiocephalic and superior vena cava.

Admission Date:  [**3318-5-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**3318-5-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**3264-6-7**]     Sex:  M

Service: NEUROLOGY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old white
man with a history of traumatic brain injury as well as
behavioral difficulty and seizure disorder who was at his
baseline seizure frequency of one to two generalized tonic
clonic seizures per month who was admitted on [**3318-5-18**] in
generalized status epilepticus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was initially given Ativan and propofol
and intubated.  He was then loaded with IV phenytoin which
stopped the seizure activity.  His workup included multiple
laboratories, cultures, head CT, and LP, and were all
negative.  It was felt that perhaps his seizures and status
epilepticus was prompted by a decrease in his valproic acid
from 750 mg b.i.d. to 250 mg b.i.d.  The patient remained
seizure-free and was extubated on [**3318-5-20**].  He was
maintained on preadmission dose of Zonisamide 200 mg b.i.d.
and Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.  His valproic acid was
titrated up to 750 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Dilantin 900 and then
taper to off.

Medically, the patient had remained stable and seizure-free
since [**3318-5-20**].  He remained in the ICU until [**3318-5-23**] until a bed was available on the Neurology floor.  The
patient's CBC and electrolytes have all been within normal
limits.  His most recent valproic acid level from [**3318-5-24**], on the day of discharge, was 52.

From a psychiatric standpoint, the patient became increasing
agitated and was voicing possible suicidal ideation.
Psychiatry was asked to see the patient.  They recommended
restarting Risperdal and Zoloft and returning to [**Hospital1 **]
Psychiatric Facility.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was in
no acute distress.  Heart and lungs:  Normal.  Neurologic:
His mental status was alert and oriented.  He was following
commands, but not very cooperative with examination.  He
would tell me the months of the year forward but would not
cooperate with the months of the year backwards.  He would
recall three out of three items at one minute but not
cooperate at five minutes.  He had no obvious apraxia and no
neglect.  His cranial nerves revealed that he did have a
right facial droop but his extraocular movements were intact,
no nystagmus.  His shoulder shrug was normal.  His tongue was
midline, no fasciculations.  His face sensation was normal.
Motor examination revealed no drift and no weakness, however,
not cooperative with individual muscle group testing.  He
would move all extremities symmetrically.  A positive
asterixis.  Sensory examination was intact to all modalities,
light touch, pinprick, proprioception and vibration.  His
reflexes were symmetric bilaterally, [**2-8**]+.  His right toe was
equivocal.  Coordination:  He would not cooperate with the
entire examination; however, finger-nose-finger was intact
bilaterally.  He would not cooperate with heel-to-shin.
Rapid alternating movements were normal bilaterally.  Gait:
Not assessed as he refused to walk.

LABORATORY DATA UPON DISCHARGE:  On [**3318-5-24**], his white
count was 7.8, hematocrit 36.5, platelets 304,000.
Chemistries were normal.  Sodium 143, potassium 3.5, chloride
109, C02 25, BUN 18, creatinine 0.7, ALT 11, AST 10, alkaline
phosphatase 82, total bilirubin 0.2.  His valproic acid was
52.

The head CT on [**3318-5-18**] showed encephalomalacia with
predominantly left frontal lobe but also right frontal lobe.
He also had small bilateral chronic subdurals.

On [**3318-5-19**], he had a LP which showed 0 whites, 0 reds,
protein 171, glucose 60.

DISPOSITION:  He will be discharged to a psychiatric
facility.  The nursing case manager of the Psychiatry
Department arranged his admission time to be 7:00 p.m.  He
will be admitted at [**Hospital1 **] HRI at [**Street Address 3188**],
[**Location (un) 3189**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3190**].  A fax of this discharge
summary should be sent there.  A section XII was done, page
one and page two, and clinical information as well as
ambulance was booked on discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Neurontin 400 mg t.i.d.
2.  Zonisamide 200 mg b.i.d.
3.  Insulin sliding scale.
4.  Pepcid 20 mg b.i.d.
5.  Valproic acid 750 mg t.i.d.

Date of Birth:   [**3188-7-11**]     Sex:  F


ADDENDUM:
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with the
complaints as above including chest pain and shortness of
breath: she was initially felt to have a left upper lobe and
a left lower lobe thrombus of indeterminate age according to
CT scan.  The patient was begun on antibiotics including 1 gm
of Ceftriaxone IV q 12 day beginning on [**10-12**] as well as 1 gm
of Vancomycin given on [**10-12**].  On [**10-13**] the patient was begun
on 1.25 gm of Vancomycin q 12 hours, all for presumed
pneumonia.  The patient was also begun on Levofloxacin 500 mg
po q day on [**10-12**].  In addition, the patient was begun on [**10-12**]
injury syndrome.  This after consulting cardiothoracic
surgery.  The Indomethacin was changed in the face of
hematocrit drop and gastrointestinal bleeding to Vioxx in the
dosage of 50 mg po q day on [**10-16**], although it was initially
suspected that the patient might have pneumonia, she did not
present with a fever nor did she present with an elevated
white blood cell count.  CT surgery consult on [**10-12**] suggested
the differential diagnosis of post pericardiotomy syndrome vs
pericarditis vs recurrent PE with lower lobe pneumonia.  The
patient was noted at the time of admission to have a
pericardial effusion.  To the date of this admission, this
pericardial effusion did not lead to signs of tamponade nor
was there radiographic evidence of such.  The patient was
initially anticoagulated with Heparin, however, in the face
of dropping hematocrit and OB+ stool, Heparin was
discontinued on [**10-15**] and the patient was transfused times two
units for hematocrit drop from approximately 27.2 to 23.8.
Because of concern about the potential underlying
coagulopathy, Heparin was restarted on [**10-17**].  Because of her
extensive psychiatric history including leaving the [**Hospital6 4513**] against medical advice, the patient was
seen on [**10-12**] by psychiatry which suggested minimizing non
essential sedating medications until the patient was more
alert.  Bronchoscopy performed on [**10-14**] showed dynamic
collapse throughout with moderate amount of purulent
secretions throughout the left bronchi.  Echocardiography on
[**10-15**] continued to show small circumferential pericardial
effusion.  As noted above, the patient's hematocrit fell
between [**10-14**] and [**10-15**] from 27.2 to 23.8.  A nasogastric
lavage was dip positive for blood but there was no gross
blood at that time.  The patient continued to have OB
positive stools and hematocrit stabilized post transfusion.
The patient was seen by hematology and it was suggested that
laboratories be sent for hypercoagulability work-up which
have been negative to date, however, in light of the
patient's compromised lung status, decision was made to
restart anticoagulation as the patient was clinically not
greatly improved.  The patient was again sent for bronchiolar
alveolar lavage with transbronchial biopsy of the lingula on
[**10-17**] which again showed diffuse dynamic collapse and purulent
secretions form the left and now from the right upper and
middle lobe as well.  The patient was seen on [**10-17**] by the
infectious disease service who felt that it was less likely
that the patient had pneumonia.  It was suggested that the
patient be checked for HIV which ultimately returned negative
because of the suggestion was made in light of the patient's
continuing pneumonic processes without elevated white count
or fever.  On [**10-17**] intern was called to see the patient for
shortness of breath, status post bronchoscopy with oxygen
saturation approximately 68% on three liters, increasing only
to 88% on five liters as well as tachypnea.  The patient, at
that time was diuresed for presumed pulmonary edema and was
also given nebulizers and improved and stayed on the floor.
On [**10-19**] the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for increasing dyspnea and desaturation on non
rebreather on the floor.   At that time the patient was felt
possibly to be in ARDS.  In the MICU the patient was treated
with Ceftaz and Clindamycin for a presumed nosocomial
pneumonia and/or aspiration pneumonia and aggressively was
diuresed for pulmonary edema.  Follow-up chest x-ray showed
improvement in the infiltrate in the right lung.  An echo was
performed which was within normal limits.  Bronchial alveolar
lavage is negative, tissue is negative, washings were
negative as were pleural fluid and blood cultures negative at
the time.  On [**10-26**] CT of the chest showed diffuse ground
glass appearance in the right lung and in the focal region on
the left lung which could represent the infectious process.
A  hemorrhage or diffuse alveolar damage
although it was considered odd that it was less than
unilateral, oxygen requirements in the MICU decreased with
diuresis in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient on [**10-26**]
required only 50% Venti Mask and oxygen saturation of 96 and
was transferred back to the floor.  The patient was continued
on Heparin as well as Coumadin for presumed coagulopathy
although again it should be noted that today these, including
anti-thrombin III, protein C and factor 5 leiden were
negative.   It was still unclear whether the patient had
actually originally had a pneumonia or other pneumonic
process.  Interventional pulmonology was reconsulted who
suggested holding on empiric steroids but pursuing the
possibility of open lung biopsy to confirm or rule out the
possibility of post pericardial injuries.  Pulmonary
re-consult suggested the possibility of "trapped lung"
regarding her left lower lobe collapse and felt thoracic surgery
should reconsult re: possible surgical decortication. They want
to f/u with pt as outpatient in several weeks and she is to have
repeat chest ct to re-assess.

he had also escorted other strange men out of the house and
is very worried about the patient and the families safety.
She also has had increased spending and has had a progressive
decline in her ability to care for herself including
decreased ambulation.  The other stresses beside her
declining physical abilities was that her fiance who was
bipolar committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in
[**3496-2-7**].  On [**3496-5-28**] she was seen by a neurologist
and an MRI was ordered.  The patient was then referred for
evaluation for psychiatric admission for behavioral control.

PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:  Admission to [**Hospital1 797**] in [**3491-3-7**] for a psychotic disorder with
hallucinations secondary to prescribed steroids.  In [**3486**] she

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 5**] Four.
A trial of Depakote ER was begun to help with her impulsive
behaviors.  Her family and her outpatient physicians were
contacted.  The patient was pleasant and involved in MILU
activities.  She did have a fall on the unit with no acute
injuries noted and fall precautions were put into place.  Her
family met with the inpatient team as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4626**] who
reviewed her recent MRI and said that it showed worsening of
her demyelinating disorder, which could be consistent with
her current change in behavior.  He would continue to follow
her.  The patient had no further urges or attempts to engage
anyone sexually and was in very good control on the unit.
She did have another fall using her walker and began to use
her wheel chair more frequently.  She denies side effects
from the Depakote.  On [**6-16**] she complained of an upset
stomach, diarrhea and a productive cough for three days with
some blood in her sputum.  She denied any shortness of
breath.  Lungs were clear on examination.  The patient had an
extensive physical therapy consult and evaluation and further
physical therapy was recommended.

Discharge planning proceeded with the patient agreeing to go
to a brief rehab stay for continued physical therapy before
returning home.  On [**3496-6-17**] the patient was being assisted in
transfer from bed to her wheel chair and had a sudden cardiac
and respiratory arrest.  CPR was initiated and she was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

In the MICU, the patient was in pulseless electrical activity
(PEA) and was felt to have suffered a massive pulmonary
embolism. She was given thrombolysis with restoration of pulse
and blood pressure while being maintained on vasopressors and
mechanical ventilation. However, despite maximum supportive
measures, hypotension became refractory and the patient died
within 24 hours of transfer to the ICU. The patient's family was
notified of the events and was with the patient in her final
hours.

week infant being transferred from [**Hospital1 160**] NICU to [**Hospital6 4313**] SCN.

HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] "[**Known patient lastname 11125**]" [**Known patient lastname 11124**] was born at 33 weeks
gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother is a
24-year-old, gravida 3, para 1, now 2, woman. Her prenatal
screens were blood type O positive, antibody negative, rubella
immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis surface antigen negative, and
Group B Strep unknown. This pregnancy was uncomplicated until the
evening of delivery when she presented to [**Hospital6 1701**]
with preterm labor and was transferred to [**Hospital1 3**]. She rapidly progressed to
spontaneously delivery. There were no intrapartum fevers or
other sepsis risk factors present.

The infant emerged vigorous. His Apgars were 8 at one minute
and 9 at five minutes. The infant's birth weight is 2460 gm,
birth length 43 cm, and birth head circumference 32 cm.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  Respiratory Status: The infant has remained in room air
    throughout his NICU stay. He had occasional episodes of
    apnea and bradycardia early in hospitalization, but
    none in over 5 days by time of transfer.  
2.  Cardiovascular Status: He has remained normotensive
    throughout his NICU stay. He has no heart murmur and
    there are no cardiovascular issues.
3.  Fluids/Electrolytes/Nutrition Status: Enteral feeds were
    begun on the day of delivery and advanced without
    difficulty to full volume feedings. At the time of
    transfer, his total fluids are at 150 mL/kg/day of
    expressed breast milk or Breast milk 24 calories per
    ounce.  Breast milk was being supplemented with HMF, and
    was changed to being supplemented with similac powder on
    day of discharge.  No electrolyte abnormalities were noted.
    Urine and stool output were normal throughout.  By time of
    discharge, infant is feeding PO and PG, with rapidly 
    improving PO intake.  He was begun on MVI supplementation.
4.  Gastrointestinal Status: He began treatment for
    hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity with photo therapy on
    day of life #3, and received phototherapy for 48 hours.  
    Peak bilirubin was 13.1/0.3.  Last bilirubin was measured
    on day of life 9 and was 9.6/0.3. 
5.  Hematology: His hematocrit on admission was 47.2. He has
    received no blood product transfusions during his NICU
    stay. His blood type is O positive, DAT negative.
    He was begun on iron supplementation.
6.  Infectious Disease Status: He was started on ampicillin
    and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk
    factors. At that time, his white blood cell count was
    10.2 with a differential or 10 polys, 0 bands and 76
    lymphs. His platelet count was 236,000. The antibiotics
    were discontinued after 48 hours when the blood culture
    remained negative and the infant was clinically well.
7.  Neurology: Audiology hearing screen has not yet been
    performed and is recommended prior to discharge.
8.  Psychosocial: Parents have been involved in the infant's
    care throughout his acute stay. The parents are Spanish-
    speaking primarily.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] is a 39 yo woman admitted to the Urology service 
for management of urosepsis.  She was doing well on IV 
antibiotics.  On the day before anticipated discharge, a midline 
catheter was placed and one hour later she was found on the 
ground, unresponsive and without a pulse.  A code was called and 
she was thought to be in PEA arrest.  After chest compressions, 
intubation, and three shocks, she regained a pulse in sinus 
tachycardia.  She was transferred to the FICU.  Echo showed 
severe LV akinesis.  A CTA ruled out PE.  Pt developed myoclonus 
secondary to anoxic brain injury.  A head CT three days later 
showed cerebral edema and herniation.  At this point, her family 
decided to withdraw care.  She died comfortably on [**3001-4-26**].  

The cause of Ms. [**Known patient lastname 7085**] unexpected and untimely death is not 
clear.  An air emboli was considered, but the midline catheter 
was placed about an hour before her unresponsiveness, the timing 
of which is too long for air emboli.  Also, there was no 
thrombus or air on CTA.  Our best formulation is that her 
cardiac arrest may somehow be related to her prior cardiac 
disease. She has had an ~18 year history of paroxysmal atrial 
fibrilliation. She was started on Profathenone, Diltiazem, and 
Toprol at [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-10**], and was discharged with 
prescriptions for these medications on [**3-12**]. However, 
Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] was not taking these medications as an outpatient, 
and did not inform her doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 **] that these 
medications were recommended to her. As a result, these 
medications were not restarted at [**Hospital3 **].  It was also 
possible, as we discussed with the family, that Ms. [**Known patient lastname **] had 
post-partum cardiomyopathy given her echocardiogram findings, 
perhaps predisposing to a dysrhythmia.  However, cardiomyopathy 
was not noted on autopsy, but rather a massive LV infarct that 
may have been secondary to a primary event that remains unclear.

ADDENDUM:  This is an Addendum to a prior dictation of [**3256-5-28**].

The patient remained at her baseline mental status.  The
acute meningeal/encephalitic process had resolved. Her
diabetes continued to be managed by [**Last Name (un) **].  She had one
further episode of hypoglycemia, likely secondary to her diet
indiscrepancies.

Her cognitive function was evaluated.  She scored a 20/30 on
her Mini-Mental State Examination.  In addition, she was
evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 808**] for a neuropsychological
evaluation.  She was believed to have a very significant
deficit relative to her intellect in the following areas: (1)
impaired visual and verbal learning, (2) reduced retrieval
skills, (3) reduced naming ability, (4) poor focused
attention, and (5) poor attention to visual details.  It was
believed that her deficits appeared to be a vascular rather
than due to an encephalopathic process at this time.

Given this evaluation, as well as Occupational Therapy
evaluation of function, her cognition impairs her to maintain
a safe environment for herself.  Overall, she is safety risk
particularly given her memory impairment.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   She was discharged to an extended
care facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Encephalitis, ? HSV.
2.  Altered mental status.
3.  Hypoxia.
4.  Congestive heart failure with left-sided heart failure
5.  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
6.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
7.  Hypoglycemic episode.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with her primary care physician in one to two weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Thiamine 100 mg p.o. once per day.
3.  Folic acid 1 mg p.o. once per day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  NPH insulin 20 units subcutaneously q.a.m. and 13 units
subcutaneously q.p.m.
6.  Ativan 1 mg to 2 mg p.o. q.4h. as needed (for
anxiety/agitation).
7.  Fioricet 325/40/50 one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. as
needed (for headache).

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 43F with h/o T1DM presented in DKA.
Plan:
1) DKA: DKA was likely a viral syndrome as she had sick contact 
with her daughter.  It was unlikely the flu as she was immunized 
and she had no other symptoms associated with the flu.  She was 
aggressively hydrated and started on IV insulin and D5 when 
sugars when less than 250.  Her AG gap closed promptly.  She was 
restarted on her insulin pump and overlapped with the insulin 
drip by one hour. Her IV fluids were discontinued once she 
tolerated oral intake.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and she was to 
follow up with them as an outpatient.  Her electrolytes were 
aggressively repleted including her potassium and phosphate 
which were within normal limits on discharge

2) T1DM: Her insulin pump was restarted when the  AG closed.  
Has optic complications including vitreous hemorrhage.

3)Anticardiolipin Ab: Her aspirin was held secondary to history 
of vitreous hemorrhage.

4)Hypertension: She was continued on her ACEI

5)H/O malignant melanoma: [**Doctor Last Name 4534**] level IV, dx 1998, right upper 
arm.  She was to followup with outpatient dermatology

ADDENDUM:  This is a continuation of the discharge summary
due to interruption of the summary by the dictation system.

On [**Hospital **] hospital day two, after the esophagoscopy was
performed, which again revealed no obvious evidence of
esophageal injury, an esophageal barium study was performed.
This was negative for any evidence of extra-luminal contrast
or esophageal rupture.  Total parenteral nutrition was
started for nutritional support.

On SICU second day, the patient was continued intubated and
was found to be coagulopathic with an INR of 1.8, which was
treated with fresh frozen plasma.  Levophed was continued to
maintain cerebral perfusion pressure but was being titrated
downwards.  The P to F ratio was 300; no evidence of acute
lung injury and the patient was found to be ventilating
easier than previously.  On second day on the floor, the
patient was noted to be improving.  The antibiotic regimen
now consisted of Pen-G, Zosyn and Fluconazole.  The patient
remained intubated and sedated.  TLS spine was cleared and
cervical spine MRI was performed which was negative for
ligamentous injury.

The ventriculostomy drain was raised to 20 centimeters of
water and was kept open.  On the day five, the patient
continued to improve; he was awake and continued to be
intubated.  Total parenteral nutrition was continued.

A four-vessel angiogram was performed to evaluate for injury;
no vascular injury was noted.  The patient was successfully
extubated on SICU day five.

On SICU day six, the patient was found to be doing well.  He
was alert and minimally conversant.  He was oxygenating well
with stable hematocrit.  The ventriculostomy drain was
discontinued on this day.  A trial of p.o. clears was started
and the patient tolerated this well.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the floor.

On hospital day seven because of comments heard by the
patient regarding feelings that perhaps he should not have
lived through the accident and apparently some degree of
difficulty understanding that his passenger had suffered a
fatal injury, there was a question of whether the patient was
expressing suicidal ideation and a psychiatry consultation
was obtained.  The psychiatric consultant felt that there was
no acute suicidal or homicidal ideation present, and their
impression was the patient would likely need therapy
following discharge during his recovery, to deal with this
traumatic experience.

The patient was found to be agitated in the evening of
hospital day six and was medicated with Haldol with good
effect.  On hospital day seven, the patient was tolerating
clears and his diet was advanced.  The patient was found to
continue to improve and was less agitated on that evening.
On hospital day eight, the patient was tolerating p.o. and
intravenous fluids were Hep-locked.

The Physical Therapy consultation was obtained.  The patient
was ambulated.  The Foley catheter was discontinued.
Dilantin was discontinued on the previous day.  On hospital
day nine, an Occupational Therapy consultation was obtained
whose impression was that there were significant deficits in
orientation, judgement, attention, and visual/spatial
relationships, with decreased ability to sequence, to problem
solve, and also to perform visual and cognitively
inter-related tasks.  Their impression was that the patient
should be referred to rehabilitation for neuro-behavioral
rehabilitation.

Service:

Patient's discharge was delayed due to a febrile episode just
before his previous discharge.  His fever reached 102.0
degrees.  The following day the patient was no longer febrile
nor was he febrile for the rest of his stay, although he was
pancultured and found to be positive for Clostridium
difficile infection.  The patient was started on Flagyl 500
mg tid.  His diarrhea has improved.  Patient's white count is
improving and reached normal range at 5.4.  He has remained
afebrile with vital signs stable.  He has been without
arrhythmias for a number of days.  He is now being

Date of Birth:   [**2910-1-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 10614**] is a 69 year-old
male with a past medical history of insulin dependent
diabetes times forty five years with triopathy including a
cerebrovascular accident in the past as well as chronic
bladder infections, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia who
presented to outside hospital in [**Hospital1 51**] on [**2979-12-28**]
with complaints of chest pain and heaviness.
Electrocardiogram changes at the [**Hospital1 51**] Emergency Room
showed ST depressions in V5 and V6, ultimately ruled in by
enzymes.  He was treated with nitropaste, Lopressor and
heparin as well as glycoprotein 2B3A inhibitors.  He was
ultimately transferred on the fifth to the [**Hospital1 74**] to the Cardiac Critical Care Unit
where he was without pain.

ADMISSION LABORATORY:  His admission laboratories were
significant for a white count of 9000, hematocrit 38,
platelet count 251, BUN and creatinine of 19 and .9.  The
enzymes from the outside hospital for his myocardial
infarction were not available at the time of this dictation.

MEDICATIONS IN TRANSIT:  Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d., insulin
13 units NPH and 15 units in the morning and NPH 15 units in
the morning.  Serax 15 to 30 mg po q.h.s. prn.  Nitropaste
one inch to the chest wall q 6, Lipitor 40 mg po q.d.
Aspirin 325 mg po q day.  Captopril 12.5 mg po t.i.d. and
Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.

He was ultimately brought to the Operating Room on [**2979-12-30**]
for a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft.  His
preoperative catheterization on [**2979-12-29**] had showed a mild
increase to the left ventricular and diastolic pressures and
an EF of 50%, 1+ MR, right heart dominant system.  The left
main coronary artery had 60% osteal stenosis.  The left
anterior descending coronary artery was diffusely diseased
with a 70% proximal disease and 60% mid disease in the left
anterior descending coronary artery.  The left circumflex has
a 60% proximal stenosis at the level of the obtuse marginal
one.  The right coronary artery had a mid 70% lesion as well
as a distal 40% just after the posterior descending artery.

On [**2979-12-30**] he went to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
where he underwent a three vessel coronary artery bypass
graft including a left internal mammary coronary artery to
the left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein
graft to the obtuse marginal one and a saphenous vein graft
to the posterior descending coronary artery.  The patient was
transported to the Post Cardiac Critical Care Unit.
Postoperatively, he was extubated on the night of surgery.
Hemodynamically he remained stable.  On the morning after
surgery his laboratories were noted for a hematocrit of 28.
His BUN and creatinine was 16 and .8.  He was neurologically
intact, cardiovascularly stable.  His chest tubes were
removed.  He was started on Lasix, Lopressor and aspirin and
transferred to the floor.  By postoperative day number two he
was ambulating at a level three approximately 250 to 300
feet.

He did have issues of some low grade postoperative delirium
felt to be secondary to his narcotics and the baseline issue
of possible dementia, hypoxia, hypovolemia, bleeding,
electrolyte abnormalities and so on were ruled out
accordingly.  The patient continued to work with respiratory
therapy as well as with physical therapy aggressively.  He
was ambulating at a level four by the date of discharge.  The
patient may be more appropriate to go to rehab and was
therefore set up for this as such.

His white count on [**2980-1-2**] was significant for 14,000
elevated from 11, hematocrit 28 and 230 for platelets.
Potassium 4.8, BUN and creatinine 23 and 1.0.  His calcium,
magnesium and phosphorous were 1.08, 1.9 and 4.0, which were
repleted as needed.  He had a chest x-ray, urinalysis as well
as aggressive pulmonary toilet to try to figure out the
etiology of his elevated white count on postoperative day
number three.  Additionally he began to have a low grade
fever of 100.8.  Subsequently the patient was placed on
Levaquin as it was felt he may have a possible urinary tract
infection and he typically was treated with Bactrim for any
evidence of a urinary tract infection.  He ultimately never
spiked higher then 100.8.  Cultures never grew anything.
Urine cultures were still pending at the time of discharge
and he is on Levaquin at present for a seven day course.  He
was afebrile times 24 hours.  On the day of discharge his
temperature was 97.7, 93 pulse and regular, blood pressure
148/70, 24 respiratory rate and sating 93% on 2 liters.
Finger sticks were mildly elevated, however, the [**Last Name (un) **]
Consult Service was working with the patient accordingly.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 150 mg po q.a.m. as well as
100 mg po q.p.m.  His h.s. NPH 16 units subQ as well as a
Humalog sliding scale with meals and 26 units of NPH in the
morning, 4 units subQ at supper.  Additional medications for
this patient includes Lasix 20 mg po q.a.m., K-Dur 20
milliequivalents po q day, Captopril 12.5 mg po t.i.d.,
Percocet as needed.  Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., Ranitidine 150
mg po b.i.d., aspirin 325 mg po q day, Lipitor 40 mg po q
day.

FOLLOW UP:  His follow up will include a follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] one month from the time of
this dictation and discharge as well as to have a wound check
from one week from the time of discharge.  He is to follow up
with his cardiologist in two to four weeks for medication
titration and overall systems review.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Status post three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting for
three vessel coronary artery disease.

CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11056**] is a
78-year-old man with a history of laryngeal squamous cell
carcinoma status post x-ray therapy initially in [**3279**] with a
subsequent left-sided partial laryngectomy due to local
recurrence, ultimately receiving a total laryngectomy in
[**3280-4-29**].  He did well from that point on prior to
admission, and was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 857**] his old
laryngologist on [**3281-9-30**] for left neck pain believed to be
due to TMJ, as well as a left external auditory canal insect
bite.  His stoma examination at that time was within normal
limits.  He recently, however, was found to have a
mediastinal mass noted on chest x-ray that was 5 x 6 cm.
This caused significant tracheal deviation to the right.  A
biopsy revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
similar to the biopsy from [**3280-4-6**].  He presented on
[**3281-10-29**] with increasing dyspnea and a 1- to 2-day history of
throat tightness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Polycythemia.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.

History of DVT and PE.

Forehead squamous cell carcinoma.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Spironolactone.
2. Coumadin.
3. Lasix.
4. Hydroxyurea.
5. Prevacid.
6. Verapamil.
7. K-Dur.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission, he was afebrile, pulse 84,
blood pressure 142/67, respiratory rate 14, and saturating 98
percent on room air.  He was alert and oriented x 3, aphasic,
in no acute distress.  He has a right frontal scar 2-3 cm
that is well healed.  Pupils equal and reactive.
Tracheostomy site clean, dry and intact with tracheostomy
collar, a large anterior mass inferior to the left tracheal
wound.  Nose:  Large septal perforation.  Oral cavity and
oropharynx within normal limits.  Tongue mobile.

Fiberoptic examination reveals vallecula within normal
limits.  No obvious mass in base of tongue or neopharynx.
However, much of the view obscured by pooled saliva.
Fiberoptic examination through the stoma shows diffuse bulge
from left shifting to right, with some narrowing of the
stoma, tapering trachea to 6 x 10 cm, the lower two-thirds of
the trachea to the carina within normal limits.

A CT scan of the airway showed a 6 x 6 cm mass in the
superoanterior mediastinum with tracheal deviation to the
right, some narrowing near the superior trachea/laryngectomy
stoma.  No fluid collection.  He was admitted to the SICU at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital for management of dyspnea.  He had
continuous pulse oximetry and close respiratory monitoring.
He was started on Verapamil, racemic epinephrine p.r.n., a
full liquid diet, plus all of his home medications, and
placed on Ancef empirically.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Chem-7:  Sodium 135, potassium
3.8, bicarbonate 96, chloride 123, BUN 16, creatinine 1.1 and
glucose 146.  White count 20.3, hematocrit 42, and platelets
48.  PT 14.7, PTT 28 and INR 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was seen by Thoracic Surgery on the day
of admission, who recommended Oncology consultation, steroids
and continuous O2 saturation monitoring.  He received
Decadron 10 mg IV q.8h. x 3 doses.  Thoracic Surgery
recommended consulting Interventional Pulmonology for
stenting and rigid bronchoscopy.  He was seen on [**10-30**] and was made NPO for possible stent placement.  On
[**10-30**], he was seen by the Department of Medicine in
consultation for preop.  The impression was, likely some
degree of coronary artery disease.  He had a tachy arrhythmia
that was not atrial fibrillation and was continued on
Verapamil and cleared for surgery.  On [**10-30**], he had
a bronchoscopy showing an intact tracheostoma with a proximal
tracheal lumen of 10-12 mm with erythematous friable mucosa.
An 18 x 40 mm covered stent was placed in the trachea and
balloon-dilated to 20 mm.  He was seen by Radiation Oncology
on [**10-30**] and was planned for palliative x-ray
therapy to the upper mediastinal mass to relieve airway
compression, after review of prior radiation history.

He was also seen by the [**Hospital 11057**] Medical Oncology Team and
the impression evidenced that the mass was not resectable.
Treatment options will include radiation with or without
chemotherapy.  The location of the mass outside the original
localized laryngeal radiation in [**3279**], may make him a
candidate for additional radiation therapy to this
mediastinal mass.  Depending on his condition following
hospitalization and radiation therapy, he may be a candidate
for concurrent chemotherapy, typically cisplatin, depending
on medical status.  A milder, gentle sensitizing chemotherapy
consisting of carboplatin and Taxol may be indicated
depending on his physical status following hospitalization.

Postoperatively, the patient did well.  His Foley catheter
was removed.  Thoracic Surgery signed off.  A [**10/3232**]-mm Bloom-

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was the 2405 gram
product of a 34 and [**2-22**] week twin gestation born to a 35
year-old G4 P1 mother.  Her pregnancy was complicated by
preeclampsia.  Prenatal screens were notable for O positive
antibody negative blood type, RPR nonreactive, Rubella
immune, hepatitis B surface antigen negative.  The mother was
group B strep colonized and had rupture of membranes less
then 24 hours prior to delivery.  No fever and received no
antibiotics prior to delivery.  The patient was delivered by
C section for preeclampsia.

The patient did well in the delivery room with Apgars of 7
and 8.  Physical examination on admission showed a weight of
405 grams (50th percentile), head circumference 32 cm (50th
percentile) and a length of 49 cm (90th percentile).

Admission Date:  [**2622-6-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2622-7-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2622-6-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:

Please see previous dictated summary for detailed history.
Briefly, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 6786**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12839**] was the former 715 gram product of a 24
and [**1-15**] week gestation pregnancy, born to a 33 year old,
Gravida I, Para 0 woman.  She was admitted with a concealed
abruption and delivered by stat cesarean section under
general anesthesia.  Apgars were one at one minute, three at
five minutes and ten minutes and three at 15 and 20 minutes.
He required intubation in the delivery room.

He was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for
treatment of prematurity.  His course has been complicated by
severe lung disease, symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus,
pulmonary hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage.  This
dictation covers the period from [**6-28**] through [**2622-7-8**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Respiratory:  [**Last Name (un) 6786**] returned from a
patent ductus arteriosus ligation on [**2622-6-29**].  He was
initially on conventional ventilator but then changed to the
high frequency oscillatory ventilator. He had increasing need
for escalating support.  His mean airway pressure was between
18 and 20.  Oxygen requirement was between 30 and 100%.  His
blood gases showed respiratory failure with carbon dioxide in
the 80's with pH as low as 7.0. His trache aspirate
was positive for pseudomonas and he continued treatment for
presumed pseudomonas pneumonia.

2.) Cardiovascular:  As noted, [**Last Name (un) 6786**] had a patent ductus
arteriosus ligation performed on [**2622-6-29**].  He continued to
have a murmur postoperatively.  A repeat echocardiogram was
performed on [**2622-7-4**] which showed no patent ductus
arteriosus, qualitatively good by ventricular function. A
prominent ridge between the left atrium appendage and the
left upper pulmonary vein, more prominent than usual, and a
thrombus could not be excluded.  No other vegetations or
thrombi were noted.  [**Last Name (un) 6786**] required extensive blood pressure
support with Dopamine as high as 18 mcgs per kg per minute.
He received multiple volume and colloid transfusions in
support of his blood pressure.

3.) Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: [**Last Name (un) 6786**] continued fluid
restriction to 120 to 130 cc per kg per day.  His most recent
weight was 996 grams on [**2622-7-8**]. Serum electrolytes were
initially notable for hyponatremia postoperatively which
corrected by day of life 26 on [**2622-7-4**].

4.) Infectious disease:  A previous blood culture had grown
staph aureus. Due to the severity of illness, he was
recultured on [**2622-7-3**] and that blood culture grew coagulase
negative staphylococcus epidermis.  Vancomycin was added to
his initial treatment with Cefotaxime and on [**2622-7-6**], his
antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn and he
remained on those through the remainder of his Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit admission.  He continued to have shifted
CBC's with white counts of 24,000.

5.) Hematology:  [**Last Name (un) 6786**] received several red blood cell
transfusions and several platelet transfusions. The etiology
of his low platelet count was not identified.  PT and PTT
were obtained on [**2622-7-7**] and were within normal limits.

6.) Gastrointestinal:  [**Last Name (un) 6786**] continued to require treatment
for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.  His
serum bilirubins persisted in the 8 to 9 range. An abdominal
ultrasound was unremarkable showing only an enlarged gall
bladder.

7.) Neurologic:  Pain management was provided with a Fentanyl
drip and frequent boluses.

8.) Social:  Due to his persistent critical status and the
escalating cardiovascular and respiratory support, the NICU
team and [**Last Name (un) 12840**] parent's discussed how best to rpovide his
care. After requesting a second opinion from a neonatologist
not involved in his crae, the team met with [**Initials (NamePattern4) 12840**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12841**].
Everyone one agreed that redirection of his care to comfort
measures was in his best interests. All were in agreemient
with this.
[**Last Name (un) 6786**] was extubated and sedated and placed in his parents
arms, where he expired at 19:15 hours on [**2622-7-8**].  He was
pronounced by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who also notified the medical
examiner. Autopsy declined. Obstetric team notified.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Location (un) 183**] [**Known patient lastname 184**] is the former 4.410
kg product of a term gestation pregnancy born to a 37-year-
old G2, P1 now two woman.  Prenatal screens:  Blood type B
positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group B Strep
status negative.

The mother was admitted for an elective induction at 41-weeks
gestation.  Antepartal course was benign.  The infant was
born by spontaneous vaginal delivery and had Apgars of 9 at
one minute and 9 at five minutes.  Rupture of membranes
occurred four hours prior to delivery.

He was admitted to the Newborn Nursery with stable
transitional vital signs.  He was monitored on hypoglycemia
protocol for large for gestational age status.  Initial blood
glucose was 44, then 70, and 73 on feedings.  The infant had
two episodes of cyanosis one with spitting and the second one
while attempting to breast feed.  He was transferred to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and
treatment.

On admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, his oxygen
saturations were noted to be in the low 80 percent range.  He
was started on nasal cannula O2.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION UPON ADMISSION TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT:  Weight 4.410 kg, length 21 cm, head circumference
36.5 cm all parameters greater than 90th percentile for
gestational age.  General:  Pink, large for gestational age
infant in nasal cannula oxygen.  Mild respiratory distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:  Soft anterior fontanel,
intact palate, normal facies.  Chest:  Mild retractions.
Fair air entry with coarse breath sounds.  Cardiovascular:
No murmur, present femoral pulses.  Abdomen is soft, flat,
nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  GU:  Normal phallus.
Testes descended bilaterally.  Musculoskeletal:  Stable hips.
Normal perfusion.  Neuro:  Normal tone and activity.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:  Respiratory:  [**Location (un) 183**] initially required 1 liter of
nasal cannula oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations greater
than 94 percent.  His oxygen was weaned over the
next 3-4 days and he weaned to room air on day of life number
four.  He has been in room air for the three days prior to
discharge.  At the time of discharge, his respiratory rates
are 40-60/minute.  He had an arterial blood gas upon
admission with a pH of 7.29, PCO2 of 43, and a PO2 of 82.  A
chest x-ray obtained shortly after admission to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit showed confluent parenchymal opacities in
the right upper, middle, and lower lobes, and a small right
pleural effusion.

The clinical presentation and chest x-ray were consistent
with neonatal pneumonia, and he was treated with a seven day
course of antibiotics.

Cardiovascular:  [**Location (un) 183**] has maintained normal heart rates
and blood pressures.  No murmurs have been noted.

Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  [**Location (un) 183**] was initially
maintained on intravenous fluids until his respiratory
distress resolved.  He resumed breast feeding on day of life
number two and exclusively has breast fed or taken formula
since day of life number two.  At the time of discharge, his
weight is 4.395 kg.

Infectious disease:  Due to his respiratory distress, [**Location (un) 183**]
was evaluated for sepsis.  At the time of admission to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, a white blood cell count was
3,900 with a differential of 31 percent polymorphonuclear
cells, 16 band neutrophils, 2 metamyelocytes for an immature
to total ratio of 0.36.  A blood culture was obtained prior
to starting intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin.  The blood
culture was no growth at 72 hours.  A lumbar puncture was
performed on day of life number one and had 2 white cells per
high power field with 12 percent polymorphonuclear cells, 41
percent lymphocytes, 35 percent monocytes, 1 eosinophil, and
11 macrophages.  Glucose and protein were normal.  There were
no organisms seen on the Gram stain, and the cerebrospinal
culture was no growth.

As previously noted, [**Location (un) 183**] received a seven day course of
intravenous antibiotics for clinical pneumonia.

Gastrointestinal:  Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day of
life number two, total of 8.5/0.3 mg/dl direct.  A repeat
serum bilirubin on day of life four was a total of 7.5/0.3
mg/dl.

Hematological:  Hematocrit at birth was 59.3 percent.  The
complete blood count was repeated on day of life number two
with an increase in white count to 21.8 percent and a more
normal differential of 67 percent polys and 0 percent bands.
Repeat hematocrit at that time was 59.1 percent.  [**Location (un) 183**] did
not receive any transfusions of blood products.

Neurology:  [**Location (un) 183**] has maintained a normal neurological
examination during admission and there are no neurological
concerns at the time of discharge.

Service:  TRAUMA S.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old
female who is status post rollover motor vehicle accident in
which she was an unrestrained passenger.  The patient had
vascular compromise of the right upper extremity and positive
loss of consciousness.  The patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 10**] from [**Hospital 2573**] Hospital in
[**Location (un) 1064**].  While at [**Hospital 2573**] Hospital the patient had a
pulseless right arm, which did have a Dopplerable pulse.
While at [**Hospital 2573**] Hospital the patient had a head CT, which was
negative.  Also, the patient had no movement or feeling in
her right arm.  The patient was transferred by helicopter to
[**Hospital1 10**] Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history
for seizures.  The patient takes phenobarbital.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

Upon arrival at the [**Hospital1 10**]
Emergency Room, the patient's temperature was 97, blood
pressure was 130/78, heart rate 80, respiratory rate 20.  She
was on 100% nonrebreather mask.  Her pupils were equal,
round, and reactive.  She had extraocular muscles intact.
She had a 2 cm to 3 cm laceration on the right side of her
scalp.  She had no malocclusion of her teeth.  NECK:  She was
in a cervical spine collar.  CHEST:  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  She had tenderness on her anterior
chest and sternum.  She had no crepitus.  She had positive
ecchymosis on the right scapula.  CARDIAC:  Examination
revealed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  ABDOMEN:
Soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
BACK:  Positive tenderness at T8.  There were no stepoffs, no
deformity.  RECTAL:  On examination, she had normal rectal
tone, guaiac negative.  EXTREMITIES:  She had a positive
Dopplerable pulse on the right upper quadrant, no sensation
or movement in the right upper extremity.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The
[**Location (un) 788**] Coma Scale was 15.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count was 12.2,
hematocrit 32.4, platelet count 212,000.  PT 13.8, PTT 21.2,
INR 1.2.  Blood gas 7.40, 39, 78, 25, and 0.  Chem 7:  Sodium
138, potassium 3.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.7.  The patient had an angiogram done, which
showed a right axillary artery disruption.  The patient was
seen by the Department of Vascular Surgery and taken to the
operating room, where she underwent a right axial-brachial
bypass with reverse greater saphenous vein.  There were no
complications during surgery.  The patient recovered well in
the PACU.  The patient was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient was
transferred to the floor on hospital day #2.  The patient's
chest x-ray showed rib fractures on the right and a right
scapular fracture with involvement of the intraarticular
surface of the glenoid.  Abdominal CT was negative and
cervical spine CT was negative.  The scapular fracture was
assessed by the Department of Orthopedic Surgery.  It was
determined that the comminuted scapular fracture could be
repaired nonemergently and it was determined for that to be
done two weeks after discharge from the hospital.

The patient was also assessed by the Department of Neurology.
It was suspected that she has a brachial plexus injury with
possible nerve root tear or avulsion.  MRI of the shoulder
was attempted, but the patient did not fit into the scanner.
It was determined that instead of MRI, the patient could wait
two weeks and then receive electromyelogram to test nerve
function of the brachial plexus on an outpatient basis.  The
[**Hospital 101**] hospital course was marked by a decrease in her
hematocrit during day #3 to a low of 22.  The patient
received two units of packed red blood cell transfusion with
a resulting hematocrit of 28.  On discharge, the hematocrit
was 29.8.  During the hospital course the patient was also
repleted with potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus.  The
[**Hospital 101**] hospital recovery was, otherwise, uneventful.  She
was evaluated by the Departments of Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy and given treatment and instructions on
activities of daily living, mobility and compensatory
mechanisms with limited or no use of her right arm at this
time.  During her hospital stay, the physical examination of
her right arm was not changed dramatically.  She appears to
have some sensation to light touch of her right arm.
Sensation and touch seems to localize to her epigastric area.

On the day of discharge, the patient also reported some
shooting pain into her right arm.  It is unclear if this was
phantom pain or true pain transmitting from the limb.  The
patient has continued to have no voluntary movement of her
right arm.  The arm has continued to be warm with a strong
radial pulse since the bypass graft.  The patient was cleared
for discharge from PT and OT and prepared for discharge on
hospital day #6.  Because the patient has no insurance and
case manager was unable to set up any home care for her, plan
has been developed for her to continue rehabilitation from
home with the help of family members and followup with her
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Hospital1 2574**],
[**Doctor Last Name **].

On discharge, the patient has been given instructions to
followup in one week with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2467**], Department of
Orthopedics here at [**Hospital3 **] for repeat shoulder x-rays
and examination with the goal of surgical repair of the right
scapula in approximately two weeks after discharge.  We are
unable to arrange any followup with [**Hospital1 1205**] Neurology.  It was determined with the patient
that it would be better for her to followup with the
neurologist in her home area with referral from her primary
care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] neurologist that she sees in [**Hospital1 2574**]
can assess her brachial plexus injury and determine what
further diagnostic modalities may be needed, although it
should be noted that Neurology here had recommended EMG in
two weeks.

The patient was discharged with instructions to use a sling
and swathe of her right shoulder at all times.  She is
instructed to use the exercises and skills as taught to her
by PT and OT.  She was told to followup with her primary care
physician early next week.  She was discharged with a
prescription for Percocet total count 20 for pain and a
prescription for phenobarbital total count 21, because it was
not clear if she would be going home or staying with
relatives.  It is not clear if she has a supply of medication
with her.  The patient's sutures and staples of her head
laceration were removed on day of discharge.  The patient has
staples at the site of the saphenous vein donor site, which
will need to be removed by her primary care physician in
approximately two weeks post surgery, which would be around
[**7-8**].

On discharge, the patient's diagnoses were the following:

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right axillary artery injury repaired by saphenous vein
bypass graft.
2.  Right scapular fracture.
3.  Right brachial plexus injury.
4.  Head laceration.
5.  Rib fractures.
6.  Closed head injury.

Admission Date: [**3495-6-12**]        Discharge Date: [**3495-7-15**]

Date of Birth:  [**3495-6-12**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 852**] [**Known patient lastname 853**] is the former
1.925 kg product of a twin gestation pregnancy born to a 32-
year-old G1, P0 woman.  Prenatal screens:  Blood type A
positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, group B Strep status
unknown.  The pregnancy was complicated by twin gestation
with development of twin to twin transfusion syndrome.
Oligohydramnios was noted in twin number two.  The mother was
taken to elective cesarean section at 31-4/7 weeks gestations
for concerns for the twin to twin transfusion and the poor
biophysical profile of twin number two.

This twin number one emerged with spontaneous respirations.
Apgars were 7 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes.  He was
admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of
prematurity.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION TO THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE
UNIT:  Weight 1.925 kg (75th-90th percentile).  Length 41 cm
(25th-50th percentile).  Head circumference 31.5 cm (90th
percentile).  General:  Extremely ruddy preterm infant in
significant respiratory distress.  Skin:  Color pink with
very ruddy undertones.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:
Anterior fontanel open and soft.  Normocephalic.  Red reflex
deferred.  Palate intact. Chest:  Positive retractions with
flaring and grunting.  Fair aeration bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm without murmur.
Femoral pulses plus 2.  Abdomen:  No masses, three-vessel
cord, no hepatosplenomegaly.  GU:  Testes descended
bilaterally.  Hypospadias of the penile shaft noted.  Anus
patent.  Spine straight, normal sacrum.  Extremities:
Straight, hips stable.  Reflexes and neurological exams
consistent with gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:  Respiratory:  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] was intubated shortly after
admission and received two doses of exogenous surfactant.  He
weaned slowly over the first three days of life and was
extubated to continuous positive airway pressure on day of
life number three.  He remained on the continuous positive
airway pressure off and on through day of life number 11.

On day of life number 12, he was noted to have an increasing
oxygen requirement and work of breathing.  He required
reintubation and with the intubation chest x-ray, he was
noted to have bilateral pleural effusions.  These were
thought to be complications secondary to a percutaneously
placed central venous catheter.  The central venous catheter
was removed.  The pleural effusion on the left side was
aspirated, and had a fluid analysis consistent with total
parenteral nutrition fluids and intralipids.

The pleural effusions resolved, and [**Doctor Last Name 852**] was extubated on
day of life 14.  He required nasal cannula O2 for 48 hours
and has been in room air since [**6-28**].  At the time of
discharge, he was breathing comfortably 30-60 breaths/minute. His
oxygen saturations in room air were greater than 94 percent.

Cardiovascular:  A murmur was noted on day of life six and
had increasing intensity over the next 48 hours.  A cardiac
echocardiogram was obtained on [**3495-6-19**], which showed a 2
mm patent ductus arteriosus with right-to-left flow.  Also
noted with mild tricuspid regurgitation and a patent foramen
ovale.  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] received three doses of indomethacin.  A
repeat echocardiogram on [**3495-6-24**] showed a small patent
ductus arteriosus.  He has continued to have a murmur and his
murmur remains present at the time of discharge.  Cardiology
followup is recommended six months after discharge.  [**Doctor Last Name 852**]
has maintained normal heart rates and blood pressures during
admission.  A recent blood pressure is 62/34 mm Hg with a
mean blood pressure of 43 mm Hg.

Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] was initially NPO
and maintained on intravenous fluids.  Enteral feeds were
started on day of life number five, and gradually advanced.
He was made NPO for his course of indomethacin, and until his
pleural effusions resolved.  Enteral feedings were
reinitiated on day of life number 15, and gradually advance
to full volume without problems.  His maximum caloric intake
was 26 calories/ounce with added ProMod protein powder.

Feedings were noted to have frequent episodes of spitting.
These continued despite the efforts to decrease the amount of
spitting with decrease in fluid intake and postprandial
positioning.  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] was changed to Enfamil AR formula on
[**3495-7-12**], and this made a great improvement in his episodes
of spitting.  He now has not had any episodes in 48 hours
prior to discharge.  He is being discharged home on Enfamil
AR formula fortified to 24 calories/ounce either by
concentration or 4 calories of corn oil.

Serum electrolytes were checked frequently in the first two
weeks of life and were within normal limits.  Discharge
weight is 2.55 kg with a length of 51 cm and a head
circumference of 34.5 cm.

Infectious disease:  Due to the unknown group B Strep status
and his respiratory distress, [**Doctor Last Name 852**] was evaluated for sepsis
at the time of admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
His initial white blood cell count was 5,600 with 15 percent
polys, 0 percent bands.  A blood culture was obtained prior
to starting antibiotics.  The blood culture was no growth at
48 hours, and antibiotics were discontinued.  With his
respiratory decompensation associated with his pleural
effusions, on day of life number 12, he was again evaluated
for sepsis.  A white blood cell count was 13,000 with a
differential of 52 percent polymorphonuclear cells and 3
percent band neutrophils.  Blood culture and aspirate were
both obtained, and were no growth.  He was treated with
Vancomycin and gentamicin for 48 hours awaiting the culture
results.

Hematological:  [**Doctor Last Name 854**] hematocrit at birth was 68 percent.
He received a partial volume exchange transfusion shortly
after admission with a removal of 40 cc of blood exchanged
with normal saline.  His hematocrit after the procedure was
58.2 percent.  Repeat on day of life number three was 52
percent.  His most recent hematocrit was obtained on
[**3495-7-15**] and is 34 with a reticulocyte count of 4%.
My attending will fills those in.  [**Doctor Last Name 854**] blood type is AB
positive.

Gastrointestinal:  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] required treatment for unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.  His peak serum
bilirubin occurred on day of life number 10 with a total of
8.9/0.6 mg/dl, indirect of 8.3 mg/dl.  He received
phototherapy for a approximately one week.  His bilirubin
persisted in the 7-8 mg/dl range, which was felt to not
require treatment as he was beyond two weeks of age.

Urological:  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] was evaluated by the Urology service at
[**Hospital3 27**] for his hypospadias.  The recommendation
is to followup with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 109**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 855**] from [**Hospital3 27**]
Urology to schedule an appointment.  The phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 856**].  A recommended appointment is 2-3 months of age.
[**Doctor Last Name 852**] also had a renal ultrasound, which showed some mild
pelvic dilatation of the kidneys, but was otherwise within
normal limits.

Neurology:  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] has maintained a normal neurological exam
d[**MD Number 149**] admission and there are no neurological concerns at
the time of discharge.  He has had three normal head
ultrasounds most recently on [**3495-7-10**].

Sensory:  Audiology:  Hearing screening was performed with
automated auditory brain stem responses.  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] passed in
both ears.

Ophthalmology:  [**Doctor Last Name 854**] eyes were most recently examined on
[**3495-7-1**] revealing immaturity of the retinal vessels to
zone 3, but no retinopathy of prematurity.  Follow-up
examination should be scheduled for the week of [**3495-7-22**].
The examining ophthalmologist was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 124**].

Psychosocial:  The parents have been actively involved in all
aspects of their twins' care.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home with the parents.

PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 857**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Street Address 858**],

Adlib p.o. Enfamil AR 24 calories/ounce either by formula
concentration or four added calories as corn oil.

Medication:  Ferrous sulfate 25 mg/mL dilution, 0.2 mL p.o.
each day.

Car seat position screening was performed.  [**Doctor Last Name 852**] was
observed in his car seat for 90 minutes without any episodes
of bradycardia or desaturation.

State newborn screens were sent on [**6-17**] and [**3495-6-26**].
These screens on [**3495-6-26**] showed all results within normal
limits.

Immunizations received:  Hepatitis B vaccine was administered
on [**3495-7-9**].

Immunizations recommended:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be
considered from October through April for infants who meet
any of the three criteria:  1. Born at less than 32 weeks, 2.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in [**3453**], hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia, recently admitted for evaluation of a
right ankle ulcer/cellulitis.  She was discharged to home
with Keflex on [**2-23**] with a 7 to 10 day course of antibiotic
scheduled.  She was brought in today by her daughter after
being found down in her apartment. The daughter was out of
town for the last five days, returned today and found the
patient down on the afternoon of admission.  She had seen the
patient the night before and the two had had dinner and there
were no problems at that time.  There was no loss of

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4872**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.3��, blood pressure 113/68, pulse
83.
GENERAL:  Alert and oriented to person only in no acute
distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Dry mucous membranes,
bilateral surgical pupils, no jugular venous distention.
NECK:  Supple.
PULMONARY:  Bibasilar rales, no wheezes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper
sternal border with 1/6 regurgitant murmur, holosystolic
murmur at the left lower sternal border radiating to the
apex.  The PMI is nondisplaced and is a normal size.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Large 10 x 5 cm medial right malleolus ulcer
with scattered areas of necrosis and surrounding erythema.
There is no swelling.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count 10.9, hematocrit 31.5, platelets
416.  SMA-7 143, 5.7, 104, 23, 43, 1.7 and 106.  Urinalysis
showed trace ketones, small bilirubin, nitrite negative, no
leukocyte esterase, no red blood cells.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion,
but no cardiomegaly.  A head CT was negative and hip films
were also negative.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially
normotensive.  She was started on intravenous cefazolin and
developed hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the
80s.  She was then started on low dose dopamine and admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Admission electrocardiogram shows ST depressions in 1, 2, F,
V5 and V6.  T-wave inversions present diffusely.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU
with a strong concern of evolving non Q-wave myocardial
infarction.  Indeed, the patient's peak CK was 335 with an MB
of 28 and an MB index of 8.4.  The associated troponin was
16.1.  After discussion with the family, the patient was
conservatively managed and cardiac catheterization was not
pursued.

With volume resuscitation, the patient's hematocrit dropped
to 26.3.  Iron studies revealed the following:  an iron of
287, TIBC of 398, ferritin of 49 and transferrin of 306.  It
was felt that the patient had anemia of chronic disease on
the low hematocrit reflected hemodilution.  Her dose of
Niferex was increased to bid and her hematocrit remained
stable after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells.

In terms of the patient's elevated creatinine, this also
responded quickly to volume resuscitation.

The patient had recently been in house with a concern of a
right lower extremity cellulitis versus pyoderma gangrenosum.
The patient was seen by dermatology and it was felt that the
lesion was most consistent with partially treated ulcerated
cellulitis.  The patient was initially started on cefazolin
and clindamycin.  She developed diarrhea in the setting of
clindamycin therapy.  Stool toxin assays did reveal the
presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin A and the
patient's clindamycin was discontinued and she was started on
metronidazole.  On the day of discharge, the patient was
switched over from intravenous cefazolin to oral cephalexin
with no difficulties.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and it was felt
that she was unsteady on her foot and would need 24 hour
supervision.

An echocardiogram was obtained which revealed a normal
ejection fraction, normal valves and no resting wall motion
abnormalities.

On [**3456-3-10**], the patient was felt to be medically stable for
discharge.  Given the setting in which the patient was
discovered and the physical therapy evaluation, it was felt
that she would benefit from a course of short term
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Discharged to short term
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levoxyl 75 mcg po qd
2.  Celexa 30 mg po qd
3.  Anusol HC prn
4.  Calcium carbonate 600 mg po bid
5.  MVI 1 tablet po qd
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po qd

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post non Q-wave myocardial infarction, peak CK of
355
2.  Resolving Clostridium difficile colitis
3.  Preserved cardiac pump function
4.  Anemia of chronic disease
5.  Right lower extremity cellulitis complicated by
ulceration

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up in
Dermatology Clinic at [**Hospital6 273**] in
one week's time.  The patient will follow up with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3458**], at [**Hospital6 102**] in two weeks' time.

until Sunday early in the morning, 1:30 a.m., when her
husband witnessed seizure activity involving tonic collection
of right elbow and shoulder followed by clonic jerking of
right arm and head and neck.  The seizure was self-limited
and lasted about two minutes followed by seven to eight
minutes of confusion and lethargy.  She was taken to [**Hospital6 5077**] where she received six gram of Magnesium
thinking that her seizure was an eclamptic seizure.  CT of
the head in that hospital was read as negative.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 10**] and,
Sunday in the morning after arrival to our hospital, she had
a second seizure which lasted two minutes and was generalized
tonoclonic in nature.  She received further Magnesium drip
and was noted to be hypokalemic at 2.8 and hypocalcemic at
6.7, although her albumin was also low, making the three
levels of potassium and calcium higher than reported.  Blood
pressure on arrival to [**Hospital6 390**] was 157/100, and
no proteinuria was noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen by our East consult
service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5078**], on Sunday.  She was admitted to OB/GYN
service.  She was receiving Magnesium and her electrolytes
were otherwise being repleted.  During her hospital stay, the
patient had two more events which were short and self-limited
but similar in nature to her previous generalized tonoclonic
seizures.  The patient received Dilantin bolus on [**3123-6-25**],
and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further
management on [**3123-6-25**].  She stayed in the Intensive Care
Unit overnight and her condition was assessed to be
stabilized on [**3123-6-26**], when she was transferred to our
general neurology service in West Campus.  The patient
continued with Dilantin and the level was therapeutic from
[**MD Number 5079**] of admission to our service.

Admission laboratories revealed strong urinary tract
infection which was treated with Ciprofloxacin.  Of note, the
patient informed us that she was not breast feeding her
twins.  Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed no signs of
infection.  Gram stain was finalized as normal.  A magnetic
resonance imaging of brain without contrast on [**3123-6-24**],
revealed abnormal enhancement on flare images in the white
matter of the posterior lobes bilaterally.  This was
evaluated by our team to be indicative of postpartum
angiopathy.  For this reason, we thought the patient could
qualify as having the diagnosis of posterior
leukoencephalopathic syndrome.

During her stay on our team, three view image of the left
shoulder revealed sign of dislocation of the left
acromioclavicular joint.  Orthopedic surgery team was
consulted and the patient was put on sling until the day of
discharge.  She was to be followed up in Orthopedic Clinic
after discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Dilantin 300 mg p.o. once daily.
2. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg q12hours for two more days.
3. Pepcid 20 mg p.o. twice a day for indigestion if
   necessary.


FOLLOW UP:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4075**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Neurology Clinic,
2:30 p.m. [**3123-8-15**].

Follow-up with OB/GYN [**3123-7-6**], and [**3123-7-23**].

Follow-up with orthopedic surgery.  The patient is to call to
make arrangements.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 86-year-old female
with a history of congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes,
complicated by end stage renal disease and hypertension who
presented with acute onset of dyspnea.  Patient reported
being in her usual state of health until the morning of
admission, when she awoke with severe dyspnea and
diaphoresis.  She informed her niece who telephoned EMS.  Per
EMS reports, the patient was found in profound respiratory
distress, diaphoretic with pale and cool skin.  EMS also
noted jugular venous distention to her jaw, wheezing and
bibasilar rales half way up her lungs.  Pulse of 95.  Blood
pressure of 220/100.  Respiratory rate of 36 and oxygen
saturation of 90%.  Later, 100% on nonrebreather mask.  She
was placed on a high flow of oxygen and given 0.04 mg of
sublingual nitroglycerin, ten times over the course of her
stay and with EMS and 100 mg of Lasix.  Her blood pressure
improved to 164/doppler.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reported worsening lower
extremity edema and orthopnea over the past two
months,resulting in the need for two pillows and [**Doctor Last Name 292**] at
times in a chair.  Patient denied any cardiac symptoms
including angina, palpitations, lightheadedness, any cold
symptoms including fever, headaches, shakes, chills and
urinary symptoms including frequency, dysuria discharge and
any gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, emesis.

PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure.  Diagnosed of congestive heart
failure with echocardiogram in [**3105-5-22**] showing an
ejection fraction of greater than 60%.
2.  Type 2 diabetes, complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy,
and peripheral neuropathy.
3.  Diverticulosis with multiple episodes of lower
gastrointestinal bleeding.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Polymyalgia rheumatica.
6.  Urinary frequency with hematuria and proteinuria.
7.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy in [**3066**] for
fibroids.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Allopurinol 100 mg q.d.
2.  Norvasc 10 mg q.d.
3.  Atenolol 100 mg q.d.
4.  Lasix 60 mg b.i.d.
5.  Insulin NPH 10 units subcutaneous q.a.m.
6.  Tylenol 1-2 tablets q. 6 hours prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her niece.  She is widowed
with five children.  Uses a walker for ambulation.  She
smokes 20-30 pack years and quit four years ago.  No alcohol
use.  She has a history of blood transfusions, the first one
being in [**3066**] during her total abdominal hysterectomy.  Her
mother had coronary artery disease and diabetes.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  At the Emergency Department,
her vitals were:  Blood pressure of 180/doppler.  Heart rate
of 90.  Respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturation of 90%
on nonrebreather mask.  The patient was oriented times three,
bilateral diffuse crackles were found on lung exam,
nitroglycerin was titrated to 100 mcg/hour.  She was also
given Lasix 100 mg intravenously, morphine 2 mg intravenous
and aspirin 60 mg.  She was placed on BiPAP.  The patient
eventually demonstrated subjective improvement in breathing
with respiratory rate coming down to the 20s.  There was no
urine output to an additional 100 mg of Lasix intravenously.
Her arterial blood gases were 7.26, 37 and 351.  Natrecor was
started with a 2 mg/kg bolus followed by a drip at 0.01
mcg/kg/minute.  She was given Diuril 50 mg intravenous for
urine output of only 200 cc.

MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  Due to the patient's
continued poor respiratory status, she was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit with a temperature of 96.6.
Heart rate of 74.  Blood pressure of 132/58.  Respiratory
rate of 19 and saturation of 92% on BiPAP.  Her exam was
notable for jugular venous distention up to the jaw, [**1-25**]
holosystolic ejection murmur, heard diffusely over her
precordium, bibasilar crackles half way up her lungs with
anterior wheezing and 3+ pitting edema in her lower
extremities.

LABORATORIES:  Her laboratories are notable only for a BUN of
68 and a creatinine of 6.8, phosphate of 6.7 and a PTH of
1448.  Chest x-ray revealed alveolar edema.  Abdominal CT,
which was taken for concern of retroperitoneal bleed causing
a low hematocrit was unconcerning.  The electrocardiogram
revealed no changes from the previous electrocardiogram and
the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.

The patient underwent Dialysis twice over the weekend via the
left femoral for her volume overload.  Her edema and
respiratory distress resolved allowing the discontinuation of
BiPAP and she was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition on the following po medications:
Aspirin 81 mg q.d., hydralazine 30 mg q. 6 hours, isosorbide
dinitrate 10 mg t.i.d., Toprol 100 mg q.d., and Sevelamer 800
mg t.i.d.  She was also placed on an insulin sliding scale,
pneumonic boots and subcutaneous heparin.

COURSE ON THE WARDS:  In summary, we accepted an 86-year-old
female with a history of congestive heart failure, type 2
diabetes, complicated by end stage renal disease and
hypertension who presented with acute or subacute dyspnea due
to pulmonary edema secondary to either acute ischemic event
or subacute worsening of renal failure.  The patient's vitals
on acceptance were a temperature of 98, a heart rate of 88,
blood pressure of 160/99, respiratory rate of 24 and an
oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Her exam was notable
only for her 3/6 systolic murmur and scattered
bibasilar crackles on lung exam.  On Monday, the patient
refused a pharmacological stress test.  She was, however,
followed by the Heart Failure Team and educated regarding
diet modification compliance and the signs and symptoms of
congestive heart failure.  The patient underwent Dialysis on
Tuesday, the 22nd, and Thursday, without complications.  On
Wednesday, a Permacath was placed in her right internal
jugular while an AV fistula was done in her left arm, both by
Transplant Surgery.  Lisinopril was instituted in place of
hydralazine with good effect.

At the time of discharge, the patient's blood pressure was
138/60.  Heart Failure Team has given instructions not to
lower her systolic blood pressure below the 130s for now to
give her system time to adapt.  Of note, is an eye infection
that developed on Tuesday, for which the patient was given
tobramycin drops.  The patient was discharged to
rehabilitation in good condition with instructions to
continue hemodialysis regimen.  A follow-up appointment has
been arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5544**] of the Heart Failure Clinic.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This pleasant 50-year-old female was
admitted postoperatively for routine care after undergoing
her surgery on [**2626-12-19**].  On postoperative day 0, she
was doing well and had no problems; however, on the morning
of on postoperative day 12, after having her NG tube
discontinued and fluids discontinued, the patient was found
to be with an oxygen desaturation down to 88 on room air, 95
percent on a room breather.

The patient was evaluated bu the Surgical Service and
underwent a series of test and at that point underwent a CT
which found a pulmonary embolism.  The patient was taken to
the Trauma SICU for admission after undergoing her scan.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 642**] was notified, and the patient was started on a
heparin drip.

The CTA demonstrated potential flow defect, and a left upper
quadrant arterial line was placed, and the patient had her NG
tube reinserted.  The patient was monitored, and on
postoperative day 2, the 13th, the patient was started on
Levaquin for presumed pneumonia as illustrated on her chest x-
ray and CT scan.

The patient was transferred out of the unit on the 13th, and
on the 14th, the patient had received 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. on
Friday, and then on the 15th received an additional 5 mg;

Surgical Service contact, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7250**] [**Name (STitle) 7251**], and the number
there is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 797**].

The patient continued her dose of Levaquin for a total of
seven days.  Her last dose was on the day of discharge for
presumed pneumonia.  Her heparin was discontinued on the
15th, and the patient was monitored.  She continued to have
low oxygen saturations, but with aggressive pulmonary toilet
and some Lasix on Sunday, the 16th as well, as well as Monday
the 17th, the patient appeared to improve on chest x-ray, as
well as clinically.  Her oxygen saturation on the day of
discharge is 93 percent on room air.  She was instructed to
risks and benefits of Coumadin, and she agreed to take
Coumadin as prescribed by her primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was tolerating a regular diet at that point, and she was
transferred from the unit to the floor on [**2626-12-21**],
and did well otherwise.  She had no other complaints.

The patient was discharged to home with close follow-up.  She
was instructed again as to how important is for her to take
her Coumadin and that if she has any questions, she is to
either call her primary care physician's office or  Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 7252**] office.  Her goal INR will be [**1-11**].

She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 642**] in approximately two
weeks.  She is instructed that she cannot take any bread or
chips but can otherwise have a regular diet.  In addition,
all of her pills should be crushed.  She is to follow-up with
her primary care physician tomorrow and to get her INR level
checked and to schedule an appointment within a week for a
routine visit with her primary care physician.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post laparoscopic Nissen fundal
plication on [**2626-12-19**].
Complicated by pulmonary embolism on [**2626-12-20**].

Date of Birth:   [**3075-6-19**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Neurosurgery

ADDENDUM:  The patient's stay in the hospital was prolonged
secondary to the patient developing a cerebrospinal fluid
leak, which required a lumbar drain placement for one week.
The drain was discontinued on [**3119-8-21**] and the
patient had no further leaking.  The patient then developed
elevated liver function tests and amylase and lipase.  The
gastroenterology service was consulted and the patient had an
MRCP, which was normal.  The patient will require weekly
liver function tests, amylase and lipase.  If they are not
trending down to normal in two weeks, the patient will need
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 7593**] office should be called at that time.  The patient
will also require a repeat swallow evaluation in two to three
weeks.  The patient failed a swallow study on [**3119-8-12**].  The patient had an MRA to assess basilar artery for
narrowing, which showed a uniformly narrowed basilar artery
which will not require any further treatment.

The patient was discharged to rehabilitation in stable
condition and will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in two weeks, the
trauma clinic in one week, ophthalmology in two weeks and
with otolaryngology in two to three weeks, and with the
gastrointestinal clinic if his liver function tests do not
come back down to normal.  The patient's condition was stable
and he was afebrile at the time of discharge.

MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST; MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: There is increased signal seen in the posterior soft 
tissues of the neck indicative of trauma to the soft tissues. 
However, there is no evidence of ligamentous disruption 
identified involving the anterior, posterior or ligamentum 
flavum.

There is no evidence of vertebral malalignment seen with respect 
to the facet alignment.

At the craniocervical junction at C2-3 and C3-4, mild 
degenerative changes noted.

At C4-5, mild anterolisthesis of C4 over C5 is seen due to facet 
degenerative changes. There is mild foraminal narrowing seen.

At C5-6, there is posterior ridging and uncovertebral 
degenerative change with moderate right-sided and mild 
left-sided foraminal stenosis.

At C6-7, there is posterior ridging and uncovertebral 
degenerative change with moderate left-sided and mild 
right-sided foraminal stenosis.

At C7-T1 and T1-2, mild degenerative changes are noted.

Subtle increased signal identified along the endplates at C6, C7 
and T1 level appear to be secondary to endplate degenerative 
changes. The prevertebral soft tissue thickness is maintained.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of marrow edema. No evidence of 
disruption of anterior and posterior longitudinal ligament or 
ligamentum flavum. Increased signal in the posterior soft 
tissues indicative of soft tissue trauma. No evidence of 
increased signal within the spinal cord or extrinsic spinal cord 
compression. Multilevel degenerative changes.

LUMBAR SPINE:

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2 
axial images of the lumbar spine were acquired.

FINDINGS: There is mild compression of L1 vertebra visualized 
with anterior superior osteophyte between T12 and L1. The 
compressed vertebra demonstrates normal signal on T1- and 
T2-weighted images with no evidence of increased signal on 
inversion recovery images indicative of chronic compression. 
There is no evidence of marrow edema seen in the lumbar 
vertebral bodies. Degenerative disc disease is identified from 
T11-L2. Degenerative disc disease and bulging is identified from 
T11-12 to L5-S1 level without spinal stenosis. Mild foraminal 
narrowing is seen bilaterally from L3-4 to L5-S1 level without 
MRI evidence of compression of exiting nerve roots. Small cysts 
are incidentally noted in both kidneys.

IMPRESSION: Chronic compression fracture of L1 vertebra without 
significant retropulsion or spinal stenosis. Mild multilevel 
degenerative changes in the lumbar region. No evidence of acute 
fracture or marrow edema. Normal signal intensities of the 
distal spinal cord.

KNEE 2 VIEW PORTABLE RIGHT

2 VIEWS RIGHT KNEE: Comparison made to [**2968-1-29**]. ___or 
dislocation. Minor degenerative changes are seen in all three 
compartments of the knee, most prominent in the lateral 
compartment with loss of joint space and subchondral sclerosis. 
Minimal knee effusion is unchanged from [**2968-1-29**]. No lucent or 
sclerotic bony lesions are seen. Soft tissues are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Generally unchanged appearance of the right knee 
since [**2968-1-29**]. Minimal right knee effusion.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedic Spine surgery 
was consulted because of findings on CT spine imaging; he was 
noted with a T12 fracture as well as chronic L1 compression 
fracture. These injuries were deemed non operative. He was 
fitted for a TLSO brace which will need to be worn when out of 
bed. Imaging of his cervical spine did not reveal any fractures 
or dislocations and subsequently his hard cervical collar was 
removed; it was recommended by Spine surgery that he wear a soft 
collar for comfort.

Geriatric Medicine was also consulted given his age and 
mechanism of injury. Recommendations were made pertaining to his 
pain regimen. Because he was taking Vicodin at home for his 
chronic low back pain this was continued; a prn dose of Vicodin 
was added for breakthrough pain. A Lidoderm patch, which he uses 
at home for his lower back, was added and applied to his sternum 
because of the pain experienced due to the sternal fracture. He 
was also started on Calcium and Vitamin D for bone prophylaxis.

He did experience an episode of disorientation and was noted to 
have a fever during the night on HD 4. It was initially felt to 
be related to the narcotics; he instead had developed a urinary 
tract infection and was started on Cipro. His mental status has 
improved significantly.

Rheumatology was consulted for a questionable gout/pseudogout 
episode left wrist. He was given a one time dose of Toradol IV 
which helped to relieve the pain. Fluid was apsirated from his 
wrist. It was confirmed to be psuedogout and he was subsequently 
started on a steroid taper.

Physical therapy was also consulted and have recommended that 
patient go to a rehab facility post acute hospitalization.

History of Present Illness:
46 yo female with med hx of depression, suicide attempt, COPD, 
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**12-25**] after being found minimallly 
responsive by neighbor. She reported slipping on the ice 
multiple times during the past snow storm, and reported left arm 
pain and bilat LE pain. She denied CP, CT, or SOB but reported 
general malaise. She took increasing doses of both trazadone and 
Klonopin overnight due to insomnia from discomfort which is her 
last memory. On arrival EMS found empty pill bottles of 
seroquel, percocet, and trazodone and OD was suspected. In the 
ED at OSH VS were stable but ABG revealed resp acidosis and they 
decided to intubate her for airway protection. She was given 
activated charcoal for suspected ingestion. Labs revealed an 
elevated WBC 17 so she was started on ceftriaxone and 
zithromycin for possible PNA. CT head also revealed a rt 
parietal hypodensity. LFT revealed a transamiinitis thought to 
be due to APAP so NAC was started although tox screen negative 
for tylenol but positive for amphetamines. She was transferred 
to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**12-26**] where she remained intubated. In regards to 
transaminitis hepatology saw the pt and recomended NAC and RUQ 
U/S which revealed cirrhosis. Transaminases continued to trend 
down without further intervention. Parietal hypodensity on CT 
was evaluated by nuerology who recommended BP control and ASA. 
Pt also had an NSTEMI on admission with trop .32 but heparin gtt 
held due to parietal lesion which on [**12-30**] MRI showed slight 
hemorrhagic transformation. She continued to spike fevers 
despite above antibiotics so on [**12-31**] vancomycin started for 
possible endocarditis and TTE showed a severly depressed EF 
20-30% but no valvular lesions. CTPA was obtained to rule out PE 
as source and blood, sputum and urine cultures were neg. On 
admission creat mildly elevated and had high CK's suggestive of 
rhabdomylosis but this resolved with IV hydration. CT thorax 
showed bullae and pt had autopeep on the ventilator so was 
started on IV solumedrol which was weaned to oral prednisone 
after extubation. Pt was extubated on [**1-2**] and VS remained 
stable. Due to neck pain which was possibly chronic ortho spine 
was consulted and afte MRI spine revealed possible ligamentous 
injury they recommended C-spine use until follow-up in clinic. 
Psychiatry was called once pt extubated and recommended 1:1 
sitter and she was called out to the floor for further medical 
management.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2984-12-30**] 10:42 AM
There is an area of restricted diffusion within the right 
parietal lobe. There is susceptibility within the same region on 
gradient-echo images and increased T2 signal. No new areas of 
restricted diffusion are seen. There is no significant mass 
effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. 
There are multiple air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening 
within the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. 
There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmal 
dilatation of the visualized vasculature.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
46F who presented with fulminant hepatitis status post likely 
acetaminophen overdose (including narcotics and amphetamines) 
with history of depression and suicide attempts.

CVA-PT had no residual deficits on peripheral neuro exam. CT 
head read suggested old infarct although MR head more consistent 
with mild hemmorhage. MRA head showed no stenosis in ant or post 
circulation and no afib as risk for cardiac thrombus and no 
thrombus seen on TTE with repeat showing normal EF and no 
thrombus. Carotid U/S was neg but likely source was LV thrombus 
post MI although difficult to interpret repeat TTE results. We 
controlled her BP with ACE-I which were titrated as blood 
pressure tolerated and added ASA 325mg for MI prophylaxis. No 
need for anticoagulation at this time per Neurology and 
Cardiology consulatation given her recovery in LVEF and risk fo 
hemmorrhage due to poor med compliance as an outpt. Pt is 
medically clear from a neurological standpoint at this time with 
plan for only ASA 325mg qd and outpatient follow-up with 
Neurology which will be handled by her PCP.  

CAD-large hypokinetic areas on TTE suggest large infarct and ECG 
suggested evolving anteroseptal MI although repeat TTE shows 
normal EF. We continue ASA as above, Lisinopril now at 10mg and 
B blocker at 25mg qd due to normal BP's. Pt with borderline LDL 
panel prior to staring statin so cont on 10mg qd. Pt had small 
residual effusion on CXR although no further need for diuresis 
with pt having adequate O2 sats on room air. Per cardiology pt 
will need elective low intesity stress test in 6 weeks, but with 
new TTE results prognosis is much better. Pt is medically clear 
from a cardiac standpoint to DC home.
  
Hepatitis-LFT's trended back to normal limits with only NAC. 
Most likely drug induced with multiple inciting factors 
including APAP in percocet, trazadone, klonopin. Antismooth 
muscle Ab pos suggetive of autoimmune hep although [**Doctor First Name **] neg. IgG 
and Igm at normal levels, [**Doctor First Name 99**] neg, hepatitis A,B,C serologies 
neg. Unclear what etiology of nodularity of liver on RUQ in pt 
who refuses EtOH use and Hep serologies neg.  

Elevated WBC-Now normalized and pt afebrile. May be due to 
demargination from steroid use although previous fevers suggest 
other etiology. She did not complete a course of any of her 
antibiotics although fevers resolved while in MICU. Pt had 
increasing sputum production and fevers which have resovled 
since starting levofloxacin and will continue [**6-29**] day course of 
levofloxacin for PNA with CXR from yesterday clear.  

Ingestion -?suicide attempt although pt's ability to make good 
decisions is questionable at baseline. Psychiatry is following 
and recommended 1:1 sitter and now report that she will need an 
inpatient psychiatry stay. Will consult with BEST team regarding 
placement.  

Anxiety-Started Klonopin as above so stopped ativan. Pt out of 
window of withdrawal at this point. Holding on seroquel and 
trazadone per psychiatry.  
Hip pain-Pain regimen as an outpt included 150mg MS contin bid 
with percocet for breakthrough as confirmed with PCP DR [**Last Name (STitle) 6075**] 
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 8410**]. Pt seen by pain clinic at [**Hospital1 2124**] but not since [**2980**]. 
Hip films suggest no fracture and read on MRI is no pathology on 
side of pain. Pain well controlled on current regimen of MS 
contin 60mg tid and 15mg of IR for breakthrough with neurontin 
for possible neuropathic component as recommended by pain 
consult and now on tylenol.  

C-spine-Neck pain appears to be chronic although MRI Cspine 
suggestive of possible bone bruising involving C5 spinous 
process with contusion of the ligaments attached to the spinous 
process and posterior soft tissue swelling. Orthospine consulted 
and recommended f/u flexion and extension films which we were 
neg so C-collar removed. Pt will have orthopedic follow-up as an 
outpt.  
COPD-Pt has long smoking hx and cont wheeze on PE. Pt on 
steroids for >1wk so will need slower taper now at 5 mg 
prednisone qd but will discontinue tomorrow. Cont ipratropium 
and albuterol nebs with MDI's but all as prn. Pt CXR of severe 
COPD and likely has baseline low O2 sats but is not tachypneic. 
PCP is aware and will schedule pulmonary follow-up as an 
outpatient.  

Anemia-Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease. B12 and 
folate normal. Hct stable so no acute need for workup including 
bone marrow biopsy

did require PG supplementation.  At the time of transfer he is
eating 20 calorie per ounce breast milk or preemie Enfamil. Total
fluids were 150 ml per kg per day, some orally and some by gavage
and some by breast feeding.  Increased caloric density may be
required.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  He has never required phototherapy. His
peak bilirubin occurred on day of life No. 5 and was 7.6
total, direct 0.2.  His last bilirubin on [**3255-6-7**], was

feeding of 20 calories per ounce breast milk or formula with
increasing calories as needed to maintain weight gain.

The infant is discharged on no medications.

He has not yet had a car seat position screening test.

The State Newborn Screen was sent on [**3255-6-3**].

IMMUNIZATIONS RECEIVED:  He has received no immunizations.

This infant was born from breech presentation and so based on
the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation, a hip
ultrasound should be considered to rule out congenital hip
dysplasia.

IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:
1. Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from November
   through March for infants who meet any of the following
   three criteria.
   A. Born within 32 weeks.
   B. Born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of the following:
      daycare during the RSV season; a smoker in the household;

ADMISSION CHEST COMPLAINT:
1.  Free intraperitoneal air.
2.  Status post myocardial infarction.
3.  Ischemic gut.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known patient firstname 9348**] [**Known patient lastname 9349**] was a 79 year-old
Caucasian female who was referred from an outlying facility
having been approximately several days status post an acute
myocardial infarction. The patient experienced a low flow
state during this period of time. In addition she was
receiving steroid therapy for exacerbation of her chronic
lung disease. Prior to being transferred to the medical
Intensive Care Unit at the [**Hospital1 391**] the patient had undergone a CT scan which revealed
free intraperitoneal air. At this point in time the patient
had a stat transfer to the surgical service arranged. The
patient was then a direct admit to the trauma surgical
Intensive Care Unit where appropriate intravenous access was
achieved. Because of the nature of the patient's comorbidity
the family was cautioned that both intraoperative and
postoperative course were likely to be quite stormy.

The patient was taken to the operating room where upon
laparotomy an extension infarction of the colon was noted.
She underwent a total abdominal colectomy and an end
ileostomy. The patient was returned to the trauma surgical
Intensive Care Unit in critical condition. The patient was
maintained over the next 24 hours with extensive coverage
with inotropic agents and vasopressors. The patient
essentially made no meaningful physiologic recovery.
Approximately 12 hours after her surgical procedure an
extensive discussion was held with the family regarding the
fact that it will be unlikely that she will recovery. The
patient's family then asked the patient be made Do Not
Resuscitate and receive comfort measures. This was done. The

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old gentleman
with known coronary disease was in his usual state of health,
was in synagogue when he was noted to lose consciousness.  At
that time he was found to have no pulse.  CPR was initiated
with return of pulse of approximately 30 seconds later.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 391**] for workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Celiac sprue.
4. Benign essential tremor.
5. Cataracts.
6. Osteoporosis.


PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Benicar 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Primidone 75 mg p.o. q.h.s.
6. Calcium 1000 mg p.o. q.d.


ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to gluten and allergic to
seafood, which gives him hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives at home
with his wife.  There is a remote tobacco history, quit three
years ago and admits to occasional EtOH.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to [**Hospital1 **],
patient was neurologically stable and hemodynamically stable.
Patient was taken for a stress test, which was markedly
positive for ST segment changes, and decrease in blood
pressure.  Patient had also been found to have an elevated
creatinine on admission with previously documented normal
renal function.  The acute renal failure was felt to be
possibly due to the arrest.  Over the first several days of
his hospital course, patient's creatinine gradually improved.

On hospital day number five, patient was taken to cardiac
catheterization laboratory, where he was found to have an
ejection fraction of approximately 50 percent, left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 12, 60-70 percent left
main coronary disease, 70 percent LAD lesions, 60 percent
ostial left circumflex lesion, 50 percent proximal RCA
lesion, and 70 percent mid vessel RCA lesion.

Patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1142**] for coronary artery
bypass grafting, and patient was taken to the operating room
on [**5-28**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1142**] for CABG x3 LIMA to LAD,
saphenous vein graft to OM, and saphenous vein graft to PDA.
Please see operative note for operative details.  Total
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 69 minutes.  Cross-clamp time
was 45 minutes.  Patient was transported to the Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition.

Immediately postoperatively, the patient had multiple
episodes of hypotension, required significant amount of fluid
resuscitation.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was done in
the Intensive Care Unit at the bedside, which showed normal
biventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of
60 percent and no wall motion abnormality, no change from
intraoperatively.  Patient had on chest x-ray a left lower
lobe opacity with some significant respiratory acidosis
despite being intubated.  The patient underwent a
bronchoscopy, which showed minimal secretions.

Patient eventually stabilized and had good hemodynamics.  Was
weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation early in the
morning of postoperative day number one.  They vasopressors
were weaned to off on postoperative day number one.  Patient
continued to have good cardiac output and remained
hemodynamically stable.  Patient was started on low-dose
diuretics.  With the addition of the diuretics, the patient
again required low-dose Neo-Synephrine, which was used to
maintain adequate systolic blood pressure.  Patient continued
to have good cardiac output.

Patient continued to have a left lower lobe opacity on chest
x-ray.  A Thoracic Surgery consult was obtained, and per
their request a CT scan of the chest was performed, which
showed multiple prevascular lymph[**MD Number 285**] coalescing.  No
hematoma, no evidence of consolidation.  It was felt that
patient did not require any intervention for this at the
time.

On postoperative day number three, the Neo-Synephrine was
weaned to off.  By postoperative day number four, the
patient's chest tubes and epicardial wires were removed
without incident, and patient was transferred from the
Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the hospital.  The
patient began working with Physical Therapy and by
postoperative day number six, the patient was able to
ambulate with Physical Therapy approximately 500 feet and
climb one flight of stairs.

On postoperative day number five, the patient was noted to
have a rise in creatinine.  Postoperatively, the patient's
creatinine had been stable at 1.0.  creatinine had risen to
1.4.  The patient had been started on Motrin for pain relief,
which was discontinued.  By postoperative day number seven,
the patient's creatinine began to decrease to 1.3, and
patient was cleared for discharge to home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Temperature 99.4, pulse 83 in sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 111/51, respiratory rate 16, on room
air oxygen saturation 95 percent.  Laboratory data:  White
blood cell count 8.5, hematocrit 29.2, platelet count 285.
Sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 100, bicarb 34, BUN 24,
creatinine 1.3.

This is to dictate notable events since the last discharge
summary.

Patient remained in house for an additional two weeks while
rehabilitation placement was arranged.  Of note, the patient
was given a Psychiatry Consult for question of suicidal
ideation.  Ultimately, the psychiatrist felt that the patient
was not exhibiting any suicidal ideation and did not
recommend any additional treatment at this time.  The patient
was noted to have slowly increasing white blood cell count
and routing cultures were sent including sputum.  Her sputum
grew out Staph aureus, as well as enterobacteria, which is
pansensitive.  Patient was placed on vancomycin empirically,
as well as Levaquin.  The patient also had a chest x-ray
which showed a left-sided retrocardiac opacity concerning for
a pneumonia.  The patient was planned to continue course of
these antibiotics for seven days to treat this pneumonia.
Respiratory status did not deteriorate and she remained
saturating well on >.......< collar.

An additional event with the patient, she received Roxicet
for pain control.  She was noted to have several bradycardic
episodes into the 40s associated with her doses of Roxicet.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout these
episodes and the medication was discontinued and Cardiology
was called in consultation.  The electrophysiologist and
cardiologist saw the patient and felt that it may have been
medication related or possibly a vagal episode.  They did not
recommend any additional treatment or did not feel that an
electrophysiology evaluation was necessary at this time.
Patient essentially remained stable.  Despite her slightly
white blood cell count, she did not have any fevers.

She continued with Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy
as she tolerated and remained on goal tube feeds.  The
patient underwent a swallow evaluation.  She was noted to
have episodes of penetration of the vocal cords without overt
aspiration and it was recommended that she take only thin
liquids at this time, however, the patient had difficulty
taking even thin liquids.  So, essentially at the time of
discharge to rehabilitation, she remains solely on tube
feeds, >.......<.

DATE OF DISCHARGE:  [**3441-7-14**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Remain the same with the addition
of a seven day course of vancomycin, as well as a seven day
course of levofloxacin.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

Date of Birth:   [**2913-4-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:  NEONATOLOGY

Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] [**Known patient lastname 3244**] was born at 35 and 2/7th weeks gestation by
cesarean section.  Mother is a 31-year-old gravida 2, para 1
now 2 woman whose prenatal screens are blood type B+, antibody
negative, Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis surface
antigen negative and group B strep unknown.  The mother was
transferred from [**Hospital3 43**] Hospital where she was admitted in
preterm labor and a routine ultrasound showed fetal massive
bilateral pleural fluid and the mother was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 **].  The pregnancy prior to that was
reported to be  uncomplicated.  The infant emerged with a cry
and then required bag and mask ventilation and intubation. 
The Apgars were 5 at 1 minute and 7 at 5 minutes.  Also
important to note is that prior to delivery, the left chest
was tapped for 100 cc of pleural fluid under ultrasound
guidance by the obstetrician.  After intubation in the
delivery room, the right chest was then tapped for 140 cc
of pleural fluid.

The birth weight was 4225 gm.  The birth length was 48 cm and
the birth head circumference was 37.5 cm.  We estimated a dry
weight based on the 50th percentile for the infant's
gestational age of 3 kg.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  RESPIRATORY STATUS:  The infant was intubated at the time
of delivery.  He did receive one dose of surfactant for
respiratory distress syndrome.  He was extubated to nasal
cannula oxygen on day of life 13 and then weaned to room air
on day of life 24 where he remained.  He had a right and a
left thoracotomy tube for pleural effusions placed shortly
after delivery. They drained massive amounts of fluid,
however, in decreasing amounts the left tube was removed on
day of life 14 and the right chest tube was removed on day of
life 15.  The fluid analysis of the pleural fluid was
predominantly lymphocytes consistent with a diagnosis of
chylothorax.  A chest x-ray on [**2913-5-8**] showed a persistent
small right pleural effusion.  The infant does have an
increase in respiratory rate just about 70 breaths per minute
and an increased work up breathing with oral feeding.  He
will be followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 655**] of [**Hospital3 27**]
Pulmonology Department.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR STATUS:  The infant required blood
pressure support with vasopressors from the time of delivery
until day of life 6.  He has remained normotensive since that
time.  A murmur was noted at the time of admission that
persisted.  A cardiac echocardiogram on [**4-8**] and [**2913-4-13**]
showed a patent foramen ovale and some mild right ventricular
hypertension.  The murmur is now intermittent and there is no
hemodynamic significance and there was no cardiology follow
up felt to be needed.

At the time of discharge, his weight is 3505 gm, his length
52 cm and his head circumference 36.5 cm.

Enteral feeds of breast milk were begun on day of life 7 and
increased to a maximum of 20 cc per kg per day on day of life
9 when the pleural fluid changed in consistency from clear to
cloudy.  Forty-eight hours of bowel rest was undertaken and
feeds were restarted with Portagen without difficulty.  He
advanced to full volume feedings by day of life 17.  At the
time of discharge, he is eating 24 calories per ounce of
Portagen made with Portagen powder and he has taken
approximately 120 to 150 cc per kg per day.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL STATUS:  An abdominal ultrasound on
[**2913-4-10**] showed normal kidneys, gallbladder and pancreas.
Liver function tests have all been within normal limits.

His peak bilirubin occurred on day of life 7 and was total
1.5, direct 0.3.  He never required phototherapy.

4.  HEMATOLOGICAL STATUS:  Due to a persistent low albumin
and protein, he received transfusion of albumin 3x during the
first week of life.  He also received intravenous
immunoglobulin on day of life 4 and 6.  He received no other
blood product transfusions.  His blood type is A+, direct
COOMBS negative.  His last hematocrit on [**2913-4-30**] was 35.1
with reticulocyte count of 1.6%  He is receiving supplemental
iron at 2 mg per kg per day.

5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  He was started on ampicillin and
gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risks factors.
The antibiotics were discontinued after 48 hours when the
blood cultures were negative.  On day of life 9, he had a
sepsis evaluation for temperature instability.  He was
started on vancomycin and gentamicin.  These were
discontinued after four days and the blood cultures remained
negative.  He received some supplemental oxacillin doses at
the time that his chest tubes needed to be replaced, the last
one occurring on day of life #14.  He has received no other
antibiotics.

6.  NEUROLOGICAL STATUS:  A head ultrasound on [**2913-5-8**] was
within normal limits.

The infant received a continuous fentanyl infusion with
frequent additional boluses for pain management for chest
tube placement and replacement from day of life 1 until he
weaned off of that on day of life 16.  He did require some
neonatal opium solution for high neonatal assonance [**Doctor Last Name 3245**].
The last day that he received neonatal opium was [**2913-5-3**].  He
has since that time remained easily comforted.

7.  SENSORY STATUS:  Hearing screening was performed with
automated auditory brain stem responses and passed in both
ears.
     
8.  GENETICS:  Because the parents are first cousins,
chromosome studies were done on [**2913-4-17**] which
showed normal 46 XY chromosomes.  Genetics follow-up is
recommended for further evaluation of this child and to
counsel parents on any future pregnancies.

8.  PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS:  Parents are married.  They have
been very involved in the infant's care throughout his
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay.  The parents both speak
Portugese as their primary language.  The infant has a
3-year-old sister named [**Name (NI) 41**].

Service:  Medicine

Addendum:

The patient went to surgery on [**8-6**], having an
ileocolectomy secondary to a colonic mass.  There were no
intraoperative complications.  The patient went to the floor
and started developing increased oxygen requirement, as well
as elevated white count.  He was hypoxemic.  He was admitted,
over the course of a few days worsened, entered an acute
hypoxemic respiratory failure state thought to be secondary
to aspiration pneumonitis.  As it worsened, he was put on
antibiotics and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
There, he was intubated, diuresed aggressively.  There were
bilateral pleural effusions on chest x-ray.  This was
complicated by pneumothorax.  A chest tube was placed.  Once
the pneumothorax resolved, the chest tube was pulled on the
26th.

The patient, at this time, was having increasing white cell
count and on [**8-17**], had a new infiltrate on chest x-ray
and this was believed to be a persistent aspiration
pneumonia.  At this point, the family decided to not add
anymore care, to not further work up.  When the patient was
on the floor on the 27th, the family decided to remove
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10909**] [**Last Name (un) 644**] medication, antibiotics, lines and to stop
any work up for the pneumonia as well as anything invasive.
Therefore, on the 28th, the respiratory rate dropped to 6 per
minute.

There will be an addendum to possibly change the discharge
date.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease.

PROCEDURES DURING ADMISSION:  CABG times three; LIMA to LAD,
SVG to D1, SVG to DRCA on [**2545-12-6**].

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
female who is status post PTCA to the LAD in the proximal mid
and distal portions in 11/96 with respective residual
stenosis of 25%, 10%, and 10%.  Three months prior to
admission, the patient had an ETT thallium which was positive
for inferior-posterior reversible defect.  The patient
presents on [**2545-12-2**] to [**Hospital6 273**]
with the complaint of chest pain radiating to her neck and
left shoulder.  The patient woke up from [**Doctor Last Name 292**] with pain.
She had no associated nausea, vomiting, or shortness of
breath.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed a right dominant system with a 70% stenosis of the
proximal portion of the LAD of a 90% stenosis of the mid LAD
as well as a 90% stenosis involving the second diagonal
branch.  The right coronary had a proximal 40% stenosis after
the conus with serial 90% lesions in the mid RCA.  The
patient's ejection fraction was seen to be about 50%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was beta blocked and had a
preoperative evaluation.  On [**2545-12-6**], she was taken to the
Operating Room for a three vessel CABG.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  Her postoperative course was
essentially uneventful.  She was extubated.  She was weaned
from a Neo drip.

On postoperative day number one, beta blockage was begun as
was diuresis.  The patient tolerated this well.  On
postoperative day number two, her chest tubes were removed
and her Neo was weaned completely to off.  She was transfused
for a hematocrit of 26.5.

Date of Birth:   [**3371-4-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

ADDENDUM:

This is an addendum to the previously described interim
discharge summary.  Please see admission history, physical
and hospital course through [**3426-9-25**] accordingly.

HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As of [**3426-9-25**] blood pressures
continued to remain labile.  Metoprolol 150 mg t.i.d.,
Diltiazem 90 mg q.i.d., Hydralazine 100 mg q.i.d. and
Clonidine 0.2 mg t.i.d. and Labetalol drip.  On [**3426-9-26**], the patient was weaned off the Labetalol drip and
Clonidine dosing was gradually increased to maximum dose of
0.8 mg t.i.d.  The patient was also started on
Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg q.d. with little improvement of
blood pressure control.  With improvement of renal function,
an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was also added to
the regimen on [**3426-9-29**].

At this time the patient's systolic blood pressure was
staying at approximately 140 mmHg and a heart rate between 75
to 85 and a CCU Team decided this patient was stable enough
to be transferred to the floor.

Within 48 hours of transfer, the patient began to experience
chest pain with radiation to the back.  Sublingual
Nitroglycerin was given three times and 0.5 mg of IV Morphine
with mild relief.  The patient was taken for emergent CT SCAN
angiogram of the chest that revealed further increase of
thoracic luminal diameter from 3.5 to 3.8 cm, increase in
size of the luminal thrombosis and increase in size of the
lumen at the left pulmonary artery to 4.5 cm.  Cardiothoracic
surgery was consulted at this time and stated that there was
no indication for surgery at this time.

The patient was then transferred back to the CCU for more
aggressive control of his blood pressure and the patient was
restarted on Nitroglycerin drip for 48 hours.  The patient
was then started on Norvasc 5 mg.  The following evening, the
patient again experienced an episode of chest pain, but this
time without back pain and showed no clinical signs of
extension or dissection nor changes on EKG.  Later on that
evening, the patient experienced a drop in blood pressure to
systolic blood pressure of 70, 30 minutes after receiving
night time dosages of Clonidine and Captopril.  The patient
responded to 500 cc bolus of normal saline and maintained him
at greater than 60.

Within the next 24 hours, the patient had another episode of
substernal chest pain with stable vital signs and no EKG
changes.  The patient had moderate relief with Nitroglycerin
times two.  There are no EKG changes at this time.  Repeat CT
Scan angiogram revealed no progression of dissection.  Again,
blood pressure remained stable in both arms.  There are no
clinical signs for evidence of progression of dissection.
Given the episode of substernal chest pain, the patient was
started on aspirin.

The patient's blood pressure remained well controlled in the
unit.  The patient was, again, transferred to the floor on
[**3426-10-7**].  Between the time of transfer and
patient's date of discharge on [**10-11**], patient's
blood pressure was controlled on blood pressure medication.
Blood pressure medication regimen was adjusted as necessary.
Please see discharge medications for discharge
antihypertensive medications.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient completed a 14 out of 14
day course of Linezolid and aztreonam for MRSA and potential
gram negative pneumonia as per Infectious Disease.  Patient
remained afebrile with a stable white blood cell count for
the remainder of the hospital stay.

3.  NEUROLOGY:  Given patient's somnolence, confusion, mental
status changes status post extubation, Neurology was
consulted given these findings on exam.  On exam it was noted
that the patient also had a left gazed deviation, right
field, right hemiparesis.

A MRI on [**3426-10-5**] revealed:
1.  Laminar necrosis with hemorrhage in media left occipital
lobe and left thalamus.
2.  Sinus disease.

Neurology recommendations including maintaining systolic
blood pressure less than 140, keep head of bed elevated
greater than 30 degrees, and patient was followed by the
Neurology for the remainder of the hospital course.

The patient improved mental status throughout the remainder
of the hospital stay with increased speech and movement of
all extremities.  The Stroke Service was also consulted to
evaluate the patient for possible cardiac catheterization
given patient's history of substernal chest pain and possible
future need of cardiothoracic surgery for aortic dissection.
A MRI showed a left PCA involving infarct and thus it was
concluded it was best to wait two to three weeks for
anticoagulation.  Patient is to follow with Neurology Clinic
as an outpatient.

Unit No:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3844**]
Admission Date: [**3304-8-22**]
Discharge Date: [**3304-8-25**]
Date of Birth:  [**3304-8-22**]
Sex:  Male
Service:  Neonatology


Baby [**Name (NI) 106**] [**Known patient lastname 3845**] is being transferred to the Cardiology Intensive
Care Unit at [**Hospital3 27**] due to his diagnosis of
coarctation.

MATERNAL HISTORY:  Infant was born to a 32 year-old, G1, P0
mother with prenatal screens 0 positive, antibody negative,
RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative and group B strep negative mother. Of note, mother's
brother had transposition of the great arteries. Pregnancy
was uncomplicated. There was no maternal fever or prolonged
rupture of membranes.

The infant was born on [**3304-8-22**] by Cesarean section due to arrest
of descent. Some meconium was noted at the delivery.  His Apgar
score was 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  He was transferred
to the nursery for care.

On his initial examination in the nursery, he was noted to
have some perioral cyanosis and a heart murmur. He was also noted
to have a left arm saturation in the 80's and a right arm
oxygen saturation in the 90's in the nursery.  He was sent to
the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.

On admission, the infant was generally active and crying with
beads of sweat on his brow with increased work of breathing.
Temperature of 98; heart rate of 138; respiratory rate 70;
blood pressure 80/56 with a mean of 68.
Systolic BP in right arm:  80, right leg 85, left arm 76,
left leg 74, Oxygen saturation=89% in room air.
Weight of 3425 grams.  Length of 20.25 cm.
Head circumference of 35 cm. Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Anterior fontanel was open and flat.  Palate intact. Neck
supple. Breath sounds clear bilaterally with labored
breathing and some intercostal retractions and nasal flaring.
Normal S1 and S2 with a 2/6 systolic murmur.  Abdomen soft
with active bowel sounds. No masses or distention.  Anus
patent.  Normal male testes that were bilaterally descended.
Hips stable.  Clavicles intact. There was no sacral dimple.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory: Infant had an
expiratory film which suggested heart size upper limits of
normal with lung fields consistent with retained fetal lung
fluid. He initially required 400 cc of nasal cannula oxygen
and slowly was able to be weaned to room air on [**3304-8-25**].
The infant's respiratory rate became less tachypneic over the
first 48 hours of life and is currently 40's to 70's.

Cardiology:  Murmur persisted. EKG was within normal limits.
Initial hyperoxia showed a P02 of 384.  Due to persistent
murmur, the infant had a cardiology evaluation.  An
echocardiogram on [**3304-8-25**] was obtained which showed coarctation of
the aorta with a bicuspid aortic valve and a VSD. The ductus
arteriosus was patent with blood flow right to left.
The infant was then started on prostaglandin at 0.01 mg/kg/minute
and plan is now to transfer the infant to the Cardiac Intensive
Care Unit at [**Hospital3 27**] for further evaluation.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Infant has been feeding
well but due to current issues is now going to be made n.p.o.
Birth weight of 3425.  Recent weight on [**3304-8-25**] is 3270 grams, up
15 from yesterday.

Gastrointestinal:  Infant is currently on single phototherapy
for a bilirubin today of 15.9 over 0.3. Direct Coombs negative.

Hematology and Infectious Disease: Infant had an initial sepsis
evaluation with a white count of 22.8, hematocrit of 51,
platelets 245, 7 polys, 1 band, 15 lymphocytes. The infant was
started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for 48 hours pending blood
culture.

Other: Infant had a state screen that was sent today, which is
pending at the time of this dictation.  Pediatrician is Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1271**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3846**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 695**].  Pediatrician phone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 699**].

Sensory/audiology:  Hearing screen has not been performed.
Infant will require one prior to discharge home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Critical.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To level III.

Admission Date:  [**2660-12-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2661-1-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2570-8-20**]     Sex:  M

Service:  BLUMGART MEDICINE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
male who was admitted with a history of orthostatic
hypotension, atrial fibrillation, on Amiodarone, history of
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair who presents with a two to
three day history of increasing shortness of breath along
with fatigue and tiredness.  The patient was found to have an
oxygen saturation of 74% on room air; however, able to speak
in full sentences and appearing comfortable, requiring high
amounts of oxygen on nonrebreather.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was found to be
hypoxic at the time of admission with saturations of 74% on
room air.  The patient had been on Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d. that was started in [**2660-9-28**] for paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was maintained on the same
dose and it was not decreased.

Pulmonary consultation was obtained and the etiology of
hypoxia was thought to be related secondary to Amiodarone
toxicity as CT scan of the chest revealed interstitial lung
disease as well as COPD and changes consistent with
asbestosis.

The patient was started on p.o. prednisone for treatment of
presumed Amiodarone toxicity.  The patient required
nonrebreather and nasal cannula to maintain oxygen
saturations greater than 90% throughout his hospital course.
The patient had an episode of oxygen desaturation likely
secondary to self-removal of nonrebreather overnight with
resultant oxygen saturations of approximately 36%.  The
patient required intubation and was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

At this point, he was treated with high-dose IV steroids for
his Amiodarone toxicity as well as antibiotics for pneumonia
including levofloxacin, Flagyl.  The patient was eventually
extubated and was able to maintain saturations of greater
than 90% on a nonrebreather and nasal cannula.  He was then
placed on continuous pulse oximetry for monitoring of his
respiratory status.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary artery disease-The patient had
an echocardiogram which revealed an EF of 30% and new focal
wall motion abnormalities that were concerning for a recent
ischemic event as potential etiology of his hypoxia.
However, his decreased ejection fraction was thought to be
noncoronary in nature given that at cardiac catheterization
the patient only had significant disease in the right
coronary artery with 95% ulcerated lesion.  The patient had a
stent placed to his RCA and was maintained on aspirin,
statin, and Plavix postprocedure.

During the hospital course, the patient's beta blocker was
discontinued and the patient was not able to be placed on an
ACE inhibitor secondary to worsening renal function.  The CHF
Team was consulted throughout the [**Hospital 101**] hospital course.
During his Medical Intensive Care Unit course, as he became
total body fluid overloaded, he was placed on nisiritide.
However, the patient did not respond well to the nisiritide
and did not have significant diuresis on this.

3.  HYPERNATREMIA:  The patient developed a sodium of 150
while in the Intensive Care Unit and was treated with free
water boluses of 250 cc via his NG tube every six hours.

4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had a rising creatinine
during his hospital course and it was difficult to maintain
his volume status given his total body overload, CHF, and
need to give fluid for hypernatremia.

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was with a decreasing platelet
count into the low 50s.  The patient was also found to have a
positive HIT antibody while in the Intensive Care Unit.
Heparin flushes and all heparin was then discontinued.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had multiple GI issues:
(1)  Bright red blood per rectum after the cardiac
catheterization in the setting of receiving Angiomax and
Plavix during the procedure.  The patient subsequently had a
stable hematocrit and no further episodes of bright red blood
per rectum.  The patient was followed by the GI Service and
was deemed to need colonoscopy once the medical course was
more stabilized.  The patient had a rectal bag placed while
he was in the Intensive Care Unit.  Clostridium difficile was
negative times one.

The patient also had a NG tube placed while her was in the
Intensive Care Unit and received tube feeds.  He was then
kept n.p.o. as he did not do well with his swallow study and
was deemed high aspiration risk.

7.  DISPOSITION:  The patient's code status was DNR/DNI.
This was discussed with both the patient and his family which
included his brother, [**Doctor First Name **], and his sister.  The patient did
have a decline in overall status given multiple organ system
decline during the hospital course and was eventually made
CMO and placed on morphine as well as scopolamine patch and
other medications were discontinued.

The patient expired on [**2661-1-5**].

Service:  GENERAL SURGERY/PURPLE TEAM.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female with a known gastric ulcer on EGD presenting initially
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with bleeding per rectum.
The patient was in the usual state of health until the day
prior to admission, when she developed gradual weakness.  She
also had several loose stools of unusual collar and poor PO
intake.  The daughter reported noticing bright red blood in
the patient's bowel movements and brought the patient to the
emergency room for evaluation.  The patient was managed
medically by the MICU team d[**MD Number 278**] which time she received
approximately 10 units of blood over a three-day period.

On hospital day #2, the patient was taken for EGD, which
demonstrated old clotted blood in the entire stomach.  No
apparent bleeding within the stomach itself.  After
excavation and area of active bleeding was sitting in the
pyloric channel, similar to that described on 8/2002.
Hemostasis was achieved with epinephrine injections.  After
the procedure, she was discharged back to the Intensive Care
Unit for continued medical management.

On [**3191-10-3**], the Department of General Surgery was
consulted.  At that time, recommendations were made.  Medical
management was recommended, as well as discontinuing any
nonsteroidals or aspirin products with request for surgery to
be consulted if bleeding continued to be a problem.

On [**3191-10-5**], the patient was noted to become profoundly
hypotensive with blood pressure in the 80s/50s.  Surgery was
called.  Hematocrit measured at that time was 26, down from a
previous of 30.  It was determined at that time that the
patient would require an operation to repair her bleeding
ulcer.  Consent was obtained.  The patient was taken to the
operating room for a subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth II
anastomosis.  Please see operative note from
Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 642**] for details of this operation.  The
patient, after the operation, was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit, where she was given aggressive volume
rehydration.  The patient had received two units of packed
red blood cells in the MICU.

On [**3191-10-5**], she received an additional two units in the
operating room.  The patient did well within the Intensive
Care Unit.  She was gradually weaned from her FIO2 to room
air.  She was transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day #3, she was gradually advanced from
clear sips to full clears to general diet.  Due to the
patient's poor ambulatory status, rehabilitation was
considered appropriate, intermediate move from the hospital
to home.

At the time of discharge, the patient was tolerating a post-
gastrectomy diet without difficulty.  She was quite requiring
any rehydration to maintain adequate fluid.  She was voiding
and stooling normally.  Stools did demonstrate old clot
within them, consistent with the amount of bleeding that she
had had previously in her upper GI tract.  This was not
considered worrisome due to the fact that the hematocrit had
remained stable at or above 30 during this entire period.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Bleeding pyloric ulcer, status post
subtotal gastrectomy and Billroth II anastomosis.

600 in/3,050 out in the Foley and one OB negative bowel
movement.  Generally, this was a somewhat cachectic man lying
in bed in no acute distress, alert and oriented.  HEENT:
Extraocular movements intact, pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation, no scleral icterus, no
oropharyngeal thrush.  Neck, no JVD or lymphadenopathy.
Chest, diffuse bilateral rhonchi without rales.  Cardiac,

murmurs.  Abdomen, moderately distended, normoactive bowel
sounds, nontender, no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities, no edema, clubbing, cyanosis.  Neuro, no focal
neuro deficits.  Skin, no rashes present.

LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer showed white count 5.9,
hematocrit 28.5, platelet count 134,000, PT 14.9, PTT 33.3,
INR 1.5, sodium 135, potassium 3.6, chloride 104, CO2 24, BUN
10, creatinine 0.6, glucose 105, ALT 37, AST 62, alkaline
phosphatase 96, total bilirubin 1.0, calcium 8.5, phosphorus
2.9, magnesium 1.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While on the medicine unit.
[**Unit Number **].  Pulmonary:  The patient's pulmonary status continued to
improve while he was on the floor.  He initially had
complained of airway obstruction when his tracheostomy tube
was capped for speaking and this was exchanged with a smaller
diameter tracheostomy tube, which the patient tolerated very
well.  The patient's pulmonary status continued to improve
such that he gradually was weaned off the tracheostomy mask
and could tolerate room air and still hold saturations in the
high 90%.  He was weaned off his trach and decannulated from
the trach tube on floor day #6 and tolerated this very well.

2.  ID:  The patient was on Vancomycin as treatment for
pneumonia which was later complicated by ARDS.  The patient
showed no signs of pneumonia while on the floor with high
saturations, chest exam without rales.  He did cough up a
large amount of sputum on floor days #1 and 2 while his
pneumonia and ARDS were resolving but this declined towards
the end of his floor stay.  The patient did not show any
signs of other infection during his floor stay and was
continued on Vancomycin the entire time.  He will require 14
total days of Vancomycin and therefore needs to continue up
to the 14th day upon discharge.

3.  GI:  The patient has a history of alcoholic liver
cirrhosis and hepatitis C, as well as variceal bleeding,
portal gastropathy.  His liver function was stable while on
the floor with little change in his coagulation studies or
liver function tests.  The patient will require a repeat EGD
exam about 4 weeks status post discharge.

4.  Fluids & Electrolytes:  The patient experienced a large
diuresis from his ARDS third spacing while on the floor.  He
was 15 liters positive while in the unit and proceeded to
diurese to be 15 liters negative while on the floor.  Upon
discharge he was normovolemic, maintained good blood
pressures and normal pulse.  His electrolytes were stable
with occasional dips in potassium which was readily replaced
with po 40 mg of potassium.  Patient's nutritional status
upon admission to the floor, the patient had an NG tube which
was pulled out on one occasion and fell out on another.  The
patient had a post pyloric tube placed which also fell out.
During the time the NG tubes were in, he was fed tube feeds.
After the post pyloric tube fell out, the patient was given a
swallow study and deemed ready for swallowing and was given a
ground diet which was then advanced to a regular diet after
his trach was decannulated.  The patient at first took small
po but gradually was increasing to good po.

5.  Line Access:  The patient had a PICC line placed on day
#2 of his [**Hospital1 **] course for IV access for discharge antibiotics
of Vancomycin.  The patient had his central line pulled.

6.  Renal:  The patient had good renal function during his
[**Hospital1 **] stay.  No issues.  He had his Foley catheter
discontinued on day #6 of his medicine [**Hospital1 **] stay.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  He will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Alcoholic liver disease with variceal bleed, pneumonia,
ARDS.
2.  Hepatitis C.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin 1 mg IV q 12 hours for a
total of 14 days, Lactulose 15 ml po tid, Propranolol 80 mg
po qid, Pantoprazole 40 mg IV q 24 hours.  This could
actually be changed to Pantoprazole po 40 mg q 24 hours.
Spironolactone 50 mg po q d, Sucralfate 1 gm po qid,
Albuterol MDI 4-8 puffs q 6 hours prn.

The patient remained full code during this admission.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ETT placement 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
23 year old man with s/p MVC, intubated in ED. check placement 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
ETT placement 
AP CHEST, 9:56 p.m. on [**3-28**] 

HISTORY: Motor vehicle accident.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-28**] at 6:51 p.m.:

ET tube has been advanced to standard placement, tip 
approximately 4 cm from the carina. Lungs are low in volume but 
clear. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or mediastinal 
widening. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Heart, though 
not clearly enlarged, is somewhat larger than expected for a 
young patient, perhaps exaggerated by low lung volumes and 
supine positioning. Cardiac function should be assessed to 
exclude pericardial effusion and cardiac injury.

RETRO UROGRAM (74450,51610)

Reason: eval for Floey placement, urethral injury 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
23 year old man s/p mvc 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for Floey placement, urethral injury 
RETROGRADE URETHROGRAM, [**2653-3-28**] AT 18:52 HOURS.

HISTORY: Perineal trauma.

TECHNIQUE: A portable retrograde urethrogram was performed. The 
patient was not stable enough to be transported to the 
fluoroscopy suite. A scout radiograph was obtained. Of note, the 
patient has contrast within the bladder from an outside CT scan, 
which obscures the base of the bladder and the most proximal 
urethra. Using sterile technique, a Foley catheter was 
introduced into the distal tip of the penis and approximately 3 
cc of water expanded the balloon within the fossa navicularis. 
Approximately 20 cc of Conray contrast material was injected and 
the radiograph was taken with the tube obliqued to approximately 
45 degrees. The penis was repositioned and additional radiograph 
was obtained to attempt to obtain a different level of 
obliquity. The Foley catheter was withdrawn. Of note, there was 
a strong gush of contrast material and a postvoid radiograph was 
obtained.

FINDINGS: This is a limited examination as dynamic evaluation 
under fluoroscopy could not be performed due to patient 
condition. No definite mucosal injury is identified and contrast 
is noted in the more proximal aspects of the urethra. There is, 
however, marked narrowing of approximately 1.7 cm in length in 
the region of the membranous and proximal bulbous urethra. This 
is a smooth concentric extrinsic compression. No definite 
disruption is identified.

Please note, not mentioned above, there are extensive linear 
lucencies in the region of the perineum likely related to 
laceration seen intially on the scout radiograph.

IMPRESSION: Limited nonfluroscopic retrograde urethrogram done 
portably in the trauma bay. There is no obvious mucosal 
disruption. There is, however concentric extrinsic compression 
in the region of the membranous and proximal bulbar urethra 
resulting in marked narrowing. This would correspond to a type 1 
urethral injury. Please note absolute integrity of the urethra 
to the bladder is not possible given the presence of contrast 
material already in the bladder from an outside hospital CT 
scan.

FEMUR (AP & LAT) LEFT; LOWER EXTREMITY FLUORO WITHOUT

Reason: S/P TRAUMA FRACTURE FEMUR

LEFT FEMUR, EIGHT VIEWS.

INDICATION: Status post trauma.

FINDINGS: Comparison to [**2653-3-28**]. A series of eight 
intraoperative radiographs of the left femur were obtained 
without a radiologist present. These demonstrate intramedullary 
rod fixation of a comminuted fracture of the mid left femoral 
diaphysis. No immediate hardware-related complication is seen. 
Please refer to operative report for full details.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedics was consulted 
because of his femur fracture; he was taken to the operating 
room for repair of his perineal laceration and ORIF of left 
femur. Postoperatively there were some pain control issues; he 
initially required PCA Dilaudid with same fro breakthrough pain. 
he was eventually changed to oral Dilaudid which has been 
effective in controlling his pain.

Plastic Surgery was consulted because of ear and nasal 
lacerations; these were sutured in the ED, his nose required 
packing with Xeroform gauze, this was later removed. It was also 
noted that he had a right brachial plexus injury; Plastic 
surgery was consulted for this as well.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted; there were 
some balance issues initially, but then he was later cleared for 
discharge to home.

He is being discharged to home and will continue on Lovenox 
injections until follow up with Orthopedics. He will also need 
to follow up with Trauma Surgery nd Plastic Surgery in 2 weeks.

Date of Birth:   [**2610-1-10**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cadiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old female
with a past medical history significant for hypertension,
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, complete heartblock
status post permanent pacemaker placement five or six years
ago, status post corneal transplants in the past.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glyburide, Metformin, Norvasc,
Aspirin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70 year old female who presented
to [**Hospital1 **] Mishoba, [**1-13**] with acute shortness of
breath and was found to be in pulmonary edema.  She was
intubated and rule din for an anterior myocardial infarction
with a peak creatinine kinase of 530 and a troponin I of 8.5.
 The patient's admission was complicated by fevers to 100.8
with a cough.  The patient was started on Ceftriaxone at that
time and then Levaquin.  She was extubated on [**1-14**],
without incident and transferred to [**Hospital6 3341**] for cardiac catheterization.  The patient
underwent cardiac catheterization [**2683-1-18**] which
revealed an ejection fraction of about 30%, left main
coronary artery with short diffuse mild disease, left
anterior descending artery proximally with 70% disease, left
circumflex with minor disease and the right coronary artery
with diffuse moderate disease throughout the mid vessel with
more focal sequential 80% lesion.  The patient underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting times three [**1-19**], with
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
reverse saphenous vein graft from aorta to obtuse marginal,
reverse saphenous vein graft from aorta to the right coronary
artery.  The patient had a total cardiopulmonary bypass time
of 65 minutes and total crossclamp time of 34 minutes.  The
patient was transferred in stable condition to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit, being atrial paced at 80, on Milrinone
at .5, Neo-Synephrine at .5 and Propofol at 20.  On
postoperative day #1 status post three vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting the patient's 24 hour vents included low
urine output with the administration of Lasix as well as the
administration of three units of packed red blood cells.  The
patient was afebrile, vital signs were stable, still on
Milrinone at .25 with a cardiac index of 3.1.  The patient
was extubated over the last 24 hours and was currently on 4
liters of nasal cannula with good oxygen saturation.  Plan
for the day was to discontinue the Milrinone and to continue
to follow the patient's hematocrit with the last one being
31.8.  Electrophysiology came by to see the patient on
postoperative day #1 in order to adjust permanent pacemaker
to a rate of 80.  They attempted to interrogate the
pacemaker, however, it did not appear to be [**Company 2198**],
Guidant or St. [**Male First Name (un) 1593**] pacemaker and the chest x-ray did not
reveal what type of pacemaker the patient had, therefore they
suggested an epicardial pacing system to DDD at 80 to obtain
the brand of the pacemaker, if the parameters needed to be
changed then to reconsult the Electrophysiology Service as
needed.  On postoperative day #2, 24 hour events included low
urine output which the patient responded well with Lasix.
The patient was started on Dopamine at 2, still on
nitroglycerin drip at .75.  The patient remained afebrile,
vital signs were stable being intermittently ventricularly
paced at 77 with a white count and hematocrit stable, BUN 35,
creatinine 1.7.  Plan was to discontinue the Dopamine and to
administer Lasix 80 mg intravenously b.i.d. and Lopressor.
Renal came by to see the patient, due to the patient's
decreased urine output and suspected acute renal failure at
which point they felt that this chronic renal failure was
almost certainly due to the prerenal physiology in the
setting of congestive heart failure and they thought that
unless the respiratory status of the patient worsened, they
would favor avoiding further loop diuretics.  They thought
that if blood pressure increases to greater than 140 to start
Hydralazine +/- nitrate for afterload reduction which would
improve the patient's renal perfusion, and they felt that
once the patient's renal function was stable, the patient
could be started on ACE inhibitor.  On postoperative day #3
24 hour events included the helping of Dopamine and the
administration of Lasix 80 mg intravenously b.i.d. as well as
low dose Lopressor.  The patient's physical examination
remained unchanged.  The patient was alert and oriented times
three, B and V paced at 73 with a stable hematocrit and a
white count of 16.3.  BUN was 45, creatinine 1.9.  Renal came
by and saw the patient again at which time they suggested
giving a standing dose of Hydralazine 10 mg intravenously q.
6 hours to promote forward flow to add Nitroglycerin if the
blood pressure allowed, to back off on the diuretic, to dose
the medications for a creatinine clearance of 30 to 40 cc/min
and to start Sodium Carbonate 650 mg p.o. b.i.d. for after
doses.  On postoperative day #4 24 hour events included the
removal of pacing wires, increasing the Lopressor dose to 25
mg p.o. b.i.d. as well as starting Sodium Bicarbonate and
Glucotrol.  The patient also had a bout of hypertension over
night with a fluid bolus.  Vital signs remained stable.  The
patient was afebrile, sating at 95% on 2 liters of nasal
cannula.  Physical examination remained unchanged with a
white count 13 and hematocrit of 32, BUN 53, creatinine 2
with plan to decrease the Lopressor in the setting of
hypertension over night and to follow up on the patient's BUN
and creatinine with the possibility of discontinuing the
patient's Lasix.  Renal again came by to see the patient at
which time they agreed to hold the diuretics.  They also
suggested the standing Hydralazine as stated earlier, 10 q. 6
p.o.  They felt that the metabolic acidosis was improving but
to continue Sodium Bicarbonate now and they also thought that
the patient would probably need a renal follow up after the
patient was discharged.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2683-1-23**]
in stable condition.  Postoperative day #5 the patient
remained afebrile, vital signs were stable with a decrease in
white count to 13, stable hematocrit with plan to increase
the patient's Lopressor dose from 12.5 b.i.d. back up to 25
mg p.o. b.i.d.  The patient later during the day started
having some mild shortness of breath at which time the
patient's physical examination revealed mild crackles
bilaterally and with stable vital signs with a plan to check
the patient's electrocardiogram.  The patient was still 12 kg
over the preoperative weight, therefore the patient was
likely to have some fluid overload given the patient's
ejection fraction of 30%.  The plan was to check chest x-ray
and to administer 20 mg intravenously of Lasix.  An
electrocardiogram was performed which revealed no change from
the electrocardiogram performed [**2683-1-19**].  On
postoperative day #6 the patient reported feeling well that
morning.  On physical examination the patient was alert and
out of bed.  Because the patient was 12 kg above the
preoperative weight, the patient was given Lasix 20 mg
intravenously times one for pulmonary edema by examination
and chest x-ray with the patient breathing much more easily
that morning compared to the day prior.  Vital signs were
stable, putting out sufficient urine with a white count of
12.1, hematocrit of 34.6, BUN 38, creatinine 1.4.  On
physical examination the lungs were clear now.  Extremities
were warm with some mild peripheral edema.  Plan was to start
a standing dose of Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., to continue the
patient's Lopressor and probably add an ACE inhibitor for
further blood pressure control.  On postoperative day #7, the
patient was afebrile with vital signs stable with complaints
of mild shortness of breath on exertion, sating greater than
97% on room air.  Lasix was given 20 mg p.o., diuresing
greater than 400 cc after the Lasix was administered.  The
patient's only remaining issue was with physical therapy at
which time the physical therapist did not feel the patient
was ready to be discharged.  The patient's anticipated date
of discharge is [**2683-1-29**].  The patient will be
discharged home on the following medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Glipizide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for two weeks
9.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q.d. for two weeks
10. Eyedrops the patient was on preoperatively
11. Percocet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q. 4 hours prn pain
12. Sliding scale insulin

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will likely be discharged
to a rehabilitation facility in order to increase the
patient's strength and endurance.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting times three as well as complete heartblock
status post permanent pacemaker placement in the past.
2.  Hypertension
3.  Diabetes mellitus

Brief Hospital Course:
53F with solitary kidney that was removed for a renal mass 19yrs 
ago, presented with a renal mass in the remaining kidney, and 
underwent left partial nephrectomy.  Postoperative day 1 she 
developed acute renal failure and respiratory failure requiring 
transfer to the ICU.  At the time her creatinine increased to 
3.0 from a baseline of 1.4, and her blood pressure dropped to 
60/30 despite fluid boluses to 2L.  She was transferred to the 
ICU intubated and started on norepinephrine and dopamine (renal 
dose).  After 3 days in the ICU she was extubated, off pressors,

Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2394**] 
Chief Complaint:
None
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ, A-line, Intubation.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted intubated from an OSH. The patient 
required persistent ventilator support. His vent settings were 
changed for ARDS treatment, specifically pressure control with 
reduced tidal volumes (goal 450), reduced driving pressure (goal 
14). The patient required high FiO2 (60%) to maintain his oxygen 
pressure. He was continued on high dose steroids. The patient's 
IV access from the outside hospital was removed and the patient 
underwent right IJ line placement as well A-Line placement. 
.
The [**Hospital 106**] hospital course was complicated by a pneumothorax. 
It is unknown if the pneumothorax was due to prior trauma (the 
patient had a pneumothorax at the OSH prior to admission), a 
complication from central line placement or volu/[**Doctor Last Name **] trauma 
from mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent chest tube 
placement with successful reduction of his pneumothorax. The 
patient had a persistent air leak from the right sided chest 
tube. The patient required large doses of sedation and continued 
to have dyssynchrony from the vent. The patient failed a trial 
of APRV. Ultimately the patient showed no improvements in his 
respiratory status. Upon dicussion with the family it became 
clear that the patient's wish was to never be ventilator 
dependent for any protracted period of time (by the family's 
account, the patient specifically stated a desire for no 
mechanical ventilation beyond 2 days). In accordance with the 
patient's stated wishes prior to intubation as well as the 
family's wishes, the patient was extubated on [**2579-4-8**]. He 
expired within 2 hours of extubation.
.
Of note, the patient had 1+ GNR on gram stain of his sputum and 
out of concern for a possible ventilator-associate pneumonia he 
was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Ultimately sputum 
cultures grew only oropharyngeal flora. In addition, the patient 
grew coag negative staph - a likely contaminent - in 1 out of 4 
bottles of blood from his A-line.

Service:  NEONATOLOGY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known patient lastname 5776**] [**Known patient lastname 5777**] was born at
34 4/7 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida II, para I
now II woman.  Prenatal screens are blood type A positive,
antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis
surface antigen negative, and group B Streptococcus negative.
Previous obstetrical history is significant for a previous 29
week delivery of a female infant who is now alive and well.
This pregnancy has been complicated by preterm labor at 20
weeks, treated with terbutaline and at 28 weeks with
shortened cervix and spotting.  The mother was treated with
terbutaline again and betamethasone at 28 weeks gestation.
Rupture of membranes occurred six hours prior to delivery and
Pitocin was then given to augment the labor.

The vaginal delivery occurred with vacuum assistance.  The
Apgar scores were eight at one minute and nine at five
minutes.

The birth weight was 2,695 grams (80th percentile), birth
length 48.25 cm (80th percentile), and the birth head
circumference 32 cm (60th percentile).

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is a premature
nondysmorphic infant.  Anterior fontanelle soft and flat.
Palate intact.  Nevus on left neck, approximately 0.5 times
0.25 cm oval with irregular coloration, intermittent
grunting, fair aeration, regular rate and rhythm with no
heart murmur, normal pulses, abdomen soft, normal bowel
sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly, three vessel umbilical cord,
normal male genitalia with testes descended into the scrotum,
no hip click, patent anus, no sacral dimple, and normal tone
for gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  RESPIRATORY STATUS:  This infant had
initially some grunting and tachypnea which resolved by 24
hours of age.  The infant has always been in room air
throughout his NICU stay.  He has never had any apnea or
bradycardia.  On examination, his respirations are
comfortable.  Lung sounds are clear and equal.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The infant has remained normotensive
throughout his NICU stay.  He has normal S1 and S2 heart
sounds.  There were no cardiovascular issues.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Enteral feedings
were begun on day of life number one and advanced without
difficulty to full volume feedings by day of life number
four.  At the time of discharge, the infant is eating breast
milk or Enfamil 20 calories per ounce on an ad lib schedule,
taking approximately 140 cc per kilogram per day.

At the time of discharge, his weight is 2,695 grams, length
48.5 cm, and head circumference 32.5 cm.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was treated with
phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity from day
of life number four until day of life number six.  His peak
bilirubin occurred on day of life number four and was total
15.4, direct 0.4.  His bilirubin on day of life number 12 was
total 13.7, direct 0.3.  A repeat bilirubin on the day of
discharge, [**2953-12-30**], was 13.2/0.3.

The infant was circumcised on day of life number 11.  The
area is healed with granulation tissue.

5.  HEMATOLOGY STATUS:  The infant has received no blood
product transfusion during his NICU stay.  His hematocrit on
admission was 43.9 and platelets 309,000.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE STATUS:  The infant was started on
ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis
risk factors.  The antibiotics were discontinued after 48
hours when the infant was clinically well and the blood
cultures were negative.  He has remained off antibiotics
since that time.

7.  SENSORY STATUS:  Audiology-A hearing screen was performed
with automated auditory brain stem responses and the infant
passed in both ears.

8.  PSYCHOSOCIAL:  The parents have been very involved in the
infant's care throughout his NICU stay.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The infant is being discharge in good
condition.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The infant is being discharged home with
his parents.

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type
2, chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis with a history
of congestive heart failure, status post A-V fistula
placement, history of diverticulosis, status post partial
colectomy, hypertension, and abdominal hernia.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1. Norvasc 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.

10. PhosLo with meals.
11. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:
1. Demerol.
2. Valium.
3. Codeine.

This 61-year-old male was admitted to [**Hospital1 550**] on [**2984-7-25**] for increased shortness of
breath.  He was transferred from [**Hospital3 11948**], where he was
admitted for severe shortness of breath.  He was diuresed
with Lasix with no change in symptoms at the outside
hospital.  Also at the time of his admission to the outside
hospital, patient had a two week history of a cough
nonproductive with a current chest cold, however, denying any
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or chest pain.

Chest x-ray was done at the outside hospital, which revealed
bilateral pleural effusions.  EKG was performed, which
revealed new T-wave inversions in leads I, aVL, and cardiac
enzymes were performed as well showing a small increase in
troponin to 0.7 with a CK MB of 10.  The patient was treated
in the Emergency Room with Heparin drip, beta blocker, and
aspirin, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 754**] for cardiac catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization was performed [**2984-7-26**], which
revealed left main coronary artery disease and two vessel
coronary artery disease.  Patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting x3 with the left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending coronary artery.  Reverse
saphenous vein graft to the right posterior descending
coronary artery, and reverse saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal coronary artery.

On [**2984-7-30**], the patient was originally scheduled,
however, to have surgery on the [**7-29**], but when the
patient was brought to the holding area, the morning of the
10th, he was found to have an oxygen saturation of 85%,
appearing short of breath, and was tachypneic.  An EKG was
performed at that time which showed slightly worse T-wave
inversions laterally.  ABG revealed respiratory acidosis with
a large AA gradient, and the patient was postponed for
surgery and transferred to the CCU.

The evening of [**2984-7-29**], the patient had an intra-aortic
balloon pump placed prophylactically.  Patient was
transferred to the CSRU after surgery on milrinone 0.4 mcg,
0.1 mcg of Levophed, 0.15 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 20 mcg of
propofol.

A Renal consult was called on the patient the day of his
surgery and their plan was for hemodialysis the following
day, and to D/C the patient's intra-aortic balloon pump if
the patient remained hemodynamically stable.

Postoperative day one, the patient still remained intubated
on an insulin drip, a Levophed drip, as well as propofol
drip.  With a T max of 101.8 and sinus rhythm with an
intra-aortic balloon pump still in place at 1:1.  Patient was
sedated due to his anxiety upon waking up at which time he
would flail his arms causing his blood pressure to go up.
Patient also received small doses of Versed as needed for his
increased agitation upon waking.  He had minimal urine output
with a BUN of 23 and a creatinine of 5.8, and he was given
Tylenol for his fever.

His intra-aortic balloon pump was removed that same morning
after which the patient received hemodialysis.  A couple
minutes into his hemodialysis, SVTs were noted on the monitor
with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s.  A crash cart was
brought into the room for cardioversion.  The patient rapidly
deteriorated into V-tach and around 10:52 that morning, the
patient was brought to the operating room.  After several
attempts to resuscitate the patient using closed chest
resuscitative measures, the patient's chest was opened in the
ICU for open cardiac massage before being brought to the
operating room.

At that time, a left femoral and a left arterial sheath was
also placed in the left groin in an anticipation that the
patient would probably need extracorporal membrane
oxygenation.  The patient underwent placement of the
extracorporeal membrane oxygenator as well as another
intra-aortic balloon pump, and underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting x1 with a free left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending coronary artery the morning
of [**2984-7-31**].

The patient was transferred to the CSRU on vasopressin,
amiodarone, and Levophed.  Patient had chest tube output of
200 cc q 15 minutes for which he received constant infusion
of blood products with a brief attempt at CVVH, which had to
be stopped due to the fact that the patient was extremely
volume sensitive causing the patient's ECMO to chatter.  The
patient had episodes V-tach and V-fib which required multiple
defibrillations with the internal paddles as well as an extra
bolus of amiodarone. The patient was able to open his eyes
for his family, however, was maintained sedated on propofol.

Postoperative day two status post the patient's original
coronary artery bypass grafting, the patient was still on
amiodarone drip as well as cisatracurium drip, Fentanyl drip,
insulin drip, Levophed drip, Pitressin drip and remained
sedated on propofol with a T max of 101.3, and the
intra-aortic balloon pump on 1:1 ECMO in place on full
ventilatory support.  Multiple blood products were given for
volume and a low hematocrit.  The patient continued to have
large amounts of chest tube drainage from one of his chest
tubes.  CVVH was restarted.  The patient was started on
bicarb drip, which was changed over to normal saline due to
his increasing pH.

On physical exam, the patient's right foot was cool, and his
left foot and left calf were cold and slightly dusky.  DP and
PT pulses were present by Doppler on the right foot, however,
not present on the left.  The patient was unresponsive to
verbal and physical stimuli.  An increased number of
premature atrial contractions were noted for which patient
received another amiodarone bolus and around 5 o'clock that
afternoon, the patient had a 17 beat run of V-tach as well as
multiple episodes of atrial fibrillation with a heart rate as
high as 140.  Several doses of Lopressor were given
intravenously, and the patient converted back to normal sinus
rhythm.  ECMO flow was maintained at 2.6 to 2.9 liters per
minute throughout the day with a hematocrit being checked
hourly by the perfusionist with a treatment of Heparin as
needed.

Intra-aortic balloon pump remained 1:1 with good wave form.
Patient also underwent an infusion of platelets for a
platelet count of 58,000.  Multiple blood products as well as
potassium were administered to keep the hematocrit greater
than 60 and a potassium at 5.

Patient had a V-fib arrest at 9:30 that evening of [**2984-8-1**] for which they were able to resuscitate to normal
saline.  However, the patient continued to be in rapid afib
following the arrest.

The following morning, postoperative day three, the patient
was still continued on ECMO with the intra-aortic balloon
pump at 1:1 on Levophed and vasopressin as well as
amiodarone.  On physical exam, the patient still had a
cyanotic appearing left lower extremity with absent pulses
and Dopplerable pulses on the right side.  Hematocrit of
31.5.  The patient remained in stable condition with only an
increase in the Levophed drip for hypertension, and the
patient's CVVH was stopped for transport to the Cardiac Cath
Laboratory.  Due to patient's refractory arrhythmias, cardiac
catheterization revealed left main coronary artery disease as
well as two vessel coronary artery disease with a patent LIMA
to the left anterior descending artery, patent SVG to the OM,
patent saphenous vein graft to the PDA.

Patient was continued on his CVVH following his cardiac
catheterization.  On physical examination, there were noted
to be two areas on the patient's abdomen overlying the
patient's hernia, which had become dusky and mottled for
which Surgery consult was obtained.  General Surgery
recommended providing the patient with antibiotic coverage,
however, because of the patient's current condition, felt
that the patient would not be able to tolerate any type of
surgical procedure at that point.

Postoperative day four, patient remained sedated and
paralyzed on propofol, Fentanyl, cisatracurium, still on
amiodarone, Pitressin and Levophed drip.  Heart rate ranged
between 110 and 125 in rapid afib with his intra-aortic
balloon pump continuing at 1:1.  Still on CVVH on full
respiratory support.  The patient went into V-fib and after
multiple shocks returned to sinus rhythm.

He was taken to the operating room that day for the removal
of his ECMO, and the patient was transferred back to the CSRU
in critical condition on Levophed, Pitressin, amiodarone,
esmolol, and milrinone with his intra-aortic balloon pump at
1:1.  A Swan was floated in the operating room and Zoll pads
were placed on the patient's chest with the patient's chest
remaining opened secured with Ioban dressing.

Patient continued to have self-limiting runs of V tach for
which he was treated with amiodarone bolus.  CVVH was
restarted.  Patient had a BUN of 27, creatinine of 4.1,
hematocrit of 28.2, and a white count of 16.7.  While in the
operating room for his ECMO removal, patient also had his
left femoral vein and right femoral artery catheters removed
for his ischemic left leg as well as having a left femoral
thrombectomy.

Postoperative day five, patient still on an insulin drip,
propofol, milrinone, norepinephrine, vasopressin, Fentanyl,
cisatracurium, and amiodarone drips.  Afebrile with a white
count of 17.5, hematocrit of 40, BUN of 29, and creatinine
3.9.  With a failure of the CVVH early that morning, which
was then restarted still with a heart rate in the 120s SVT
and an intra-aortic balloon pump in place at 1:1.  Cardiac
index ranging between 2.8-3.

On physical exam, the patient's left lower leg was still cold
and very firm from mid calf down to his foot with his left
toes cyanotic.  Vascular was consulted, who felt that no
intervention was necessary at this time.  Patient's esmolol
and levo drip needed to be increased to maintain an adequate
blood pressure.  The intra-aortic balloon pump was later
weaned to [**1-22**] with stable hemodynamics, and the patient's
Swan was changed over wire.

Patient was transfused 2 units of red blood cells as well as
2 units of platelets for platelet count of 33,000 and 54,000.
Patient continued on CVVH for the rest of that day.

On postoperative day six, the patient was febrile to 101,
still on the following drips:  Insulin, propofol, milrinone,
Fentanyl, cisatracurium, amiodarone, esmolol, vasopressin,
and Levophed with a heart rate in the 110s to 130s in SVT on
full ventilatory support.  White count of 18, hematocrit of
43, BUN of 29, and creatinine of 3.8.  CVVH was restarted
that morning.

Neurology was consulted to evaluate the patient's
neurological status.  They recommended a possible EEG and/or
head CT to assess for hypoxia and ischemia as well as
encephalopathy.  Patient remained sedated that morning on
propofol and Nimbex with a labile blood pressure
requiring increased doses of Levophed.  Patient had runs of
V-tach that morning, treated with magnesium and calcium as
well as an amiodarone bolus.  Patient's mixed venous oxygen
saturation dropping to the 50s with decreasing blood
pressure.  The patient's PEEP was increased as well as his
FIO2 and he had V tach arrest shortly after noon that day.

Several defibrillations were performed with the patient's
rhythm varying between V tach and V fib and later
bradycardia, and complete heart block.  Continued
defibrillation attempts were made without a return of the
patient's rhythm, and the patient was pronounced at 12:44
p.m.  The patient's family was present during the
resuscitation.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with
unresectable pancreatic cancer with pulmonary embolism and
small-bowel obstruction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented to an
outside hospital on [**11-18**] after her daughter noticed
increased somnolence and vomiting.

She was taken to [**Hospital3 1827**] and was found to
be unresponsive.  She was intubated for airway protection.  A
computed tomography scan showed a small-bowel obstruction.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 104**] Intensive Care Unit.
Upon arrival a repeat abdominal computed tomography showed
ascites and partial small-bowel obstruction and enlargement
of the pancreatic head.  The patient was evaluated by Surgery
who felt that the mass was unresectable.  The small-bowel
obstruction was managed medically.  The patient was
extubated.

Her course was then complicated by development of a
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The patient was transferred to the medical floor on [**3244-11-22**] where she desaturated to 85% on 4 liters.  It was
thought that the patient had vomited and aspirated.  A
computed tomography angiogram was performed which showed
bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Lower extremity Doppler studies
also revealed bilateral deep venous thrombi.  The patient was
started on heparin intravenously and an inferior vena cava
filter was placed.  The patient subsequently developed
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome.  Her platelets
dropped from 150 to 98.  Heparin was stopped.

At that point, the patient realized her diagnosis and
prognosis.  The patient stated that she was not interested in
radiation or chemotherapy.  Code discussions were held with
the patient and her family.  She was made comfort measures
only.

The patient was transferred to the medical floor.  The
hospital course the following day, on transfer to the medical
floor, the patient passed away while on a morphine drip.  The
family were notified and declined autopsy.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Not applicable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pulmonary embolism.
2.  Deep venous thromboses.
3.  Pancreatic cancer.
4.  Small-bowel obstruction.
5.  Aspiration pneumonia.
6.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

ADDENDUM TO PRIOR DISCHARGE SUMMARY:  Hospital course from
prior Discharge Summary

The patient continued to clinically improve while awaiting
placement in a rehabilitation center.  By the time a bed was
available, the patient was clinically stable without oxygen
requirement or suctioning requirement.  The patient was 97%
on room air on the day of discharge.  The patient maintained
oxygen saturation with continued ambulation.

The decision was then made to send the patient home rather
than to rehabilitation with completion of the course of
antibiotics started in the hospital.  Per Pulmonary
recommendation, a total 28-day course was recommended (an
additional two weeks from prior recommendation).  The patient
was discharged to home on clindamycin 450 mg p.o. q.i.d. for
10 additional days and Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for 10
additional days.

The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3659**], who
is his primary hematologist/oncologist, for a plan regarding
initiating outpatient chemotherapy again.  The patient was
also to follow up with his pulmonologist as previously
stated.  Finally, the patient was encouraged to contact his
primary care physician for followup.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable, alert, and
engaging was oxygen or suctioning requirement.

Service:  Thoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old man
who presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as a referral for the evaluation
and management of a right main stem carcinoid tumor.  The
patient's symptoms included some mild flushing and hot
flashes, some lower abdominal pain, being treated by
Prilosec, and a few mild headaches.  The patient denied
musculoskeletal complaints and weight loss.  Medical history
is significant for psoriasis and kidney stones.  The
patient's medications at home include Prilosec 10 p.o. q.
day.  The patient is status post right thoracotomy, right
upper/right middle lobectomy.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, please see
operative note.  The patient's surgery finished late into the
night and the patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit for observation over night.  Postoperatively
the patient's temperature was 96.9, heartrate 90, blood
pressure 95/60, respiratory rate 14, sating at 96 to 98% on
50% face mask.  The patient had good urine output and checked
and had 140 out with an air leak.  White count was 22.6,
hematocrit was 39.8, platelets were 373.  Electrolytes were
significant for a creatinine of 1.4, an INR of 1.1.  The
patient had an epidural and Dilaudid PCA for pain control and
was stable postoperatively.  The patient was transferred to
the floor on postoperative day #1, continued on a Dilaudid
PCA and epidural.  The patient was somewhat tachycardiac on
postoperative day #2, was afebrile with good urine output.
The wound was clean, dry and intact.  The patient denied
chest pain, shortness of breath, fever or chills.  An
electrocardiogram was ordered which showed no acute changes,
ischemia and laboratory data showed a decrease in white count
from 22.6 to 17.4 and a hematocrit of 41.6, otherwise
unremarkable laboratory values.  Two chest tubes were in
place.  No air leak was noted.  The patient had coarse
breathsounds bilaterally, right more than left.  The wound
was clean, dry and intact.  The patient was being followed by
chest x-ray and pain control was continued with Acute Pain
Service following.

The [**Hospital 874**] hospital course was significant for a
temperature maximum of 101.4 on postoperatively day #4.  The
patient, being followed by chest x-ray, was encouraged to
ambulate and use incentive spirometry.  PCA was discontinued
on postoperative day #4 and the epidural with Bupivacaine
0.1% was continued.  P.O. Percocets were added and the
patient had adequate pain control with this regimen.  Chest
tubes were discontinued with the chest x-ray to follow on
postoperative day #4.  On postoperative day #5 the epidural
was discontinued.  P.O. Motrin was started and p.o. Percocets
were continued with adequate pain control.  The patient
reported three to four episodes of diarrhea.  Stool was sent
for culture and was found to be Clostridium difficile
positive times one.  The patient was started on p.o. Flagyl
for a course of ten days.

The hospital course was otherwise unremarkable.  Overall the
patient's physical examination improved.  The patient was
afebrile with a normal white count upon discharge.  The
patient was ambulating with no need for physical therapy.
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition with
the discharge diagnosis of carcinoid tumor of the right main
stem bronchus.  The patient was instructed to call a
physician if he experiences fevers greater than 101.5,
persistent or severe shortness of breath, or redness/swelling
at the incision site.  The patient's comorbidities including
psoriasis, kidney stones.  Follow up included an appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a bronchoscopy at 8 AM on [**7-21**] and an
outpatient appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4 PM, also on
[**7-21**].  Appointments were made.  The patient is status
post right thoracotomy, right upper/right middle lobectomy.

Admission Date:  [**3398-3-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**3398-3-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**3313-6-6**]     Sex:  M

Service:  VASCULAR SURGERY.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient showed minimal
response to seven days or oral Flagyl 500 mg three times a
day for his Clostridium difficile stool.  He continued to
have approximately six bowel movements a day.  He continued
to have somewhat of a decrease in his white blood cell to 16.
 It was decided by the time that he would be switched from
oral Flagyl to oral Vancomycin 125 mg p.o.q.i.d.  This is to
continue for approximately three weeks and is to end on [**3398-4-9**].  This was discussed with the Infectious Disease
Department and they agreed with this.  The patient was
started on the oral Vancomycin yesterday and feels that he
has somewhat better control of his stool today.  He had
approximately five bowel movements this morning.  White count
is stable at 16 and has been that way for approximately 72
hours.  During this whole time frame, he has remained
afebrile with stable vital signs.  He is taking in adequate
oral intake and it has been advised that he try to drink as
much fluids as possible to prevent dehydration.  We would ask
that the covering physician at the rehabilitation facility
monitor this patient for dehydration and elevated
temperatures.

Otherwise, the patient is doing quite well at this time.  He
is able to get up and out of bed to the commode and to the
bathroom without difficulty.  He has no nausea and vomiting
or abdominal pain.  He does have two small lymph[**MD Number 6119**] from
the right and left groin.  A dry sterile dressing is to be
placed over these incisions at lease three times per day to
prevent them from getting infected.  They are to be cleaned
daily.  The patient is to call should their be any redness or
erythema around the incisions in the groin.  He is to
followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1335**] in approximately one week to ten
days should there be any difficulty.  He will be discharged
to the [**Location (un) **] Rehabilitation today.











DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  (same as previous discharge summary
with the addition of the Vancomycin 125 mg p.o.q.i.d. to end
on [**3398-4-9**].

Date of Birth:   [**2759-7-20**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69-year-old gentleman with
known history of coronary artery disease who is status post a
left anterior descending coronary artery stent and status
post an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, presented to
[**Hospital3 2518**] with left chest pain and pressure radiating
down his left arm.  He took some Tums and some aspirin at
home and came into [**Hospital3 2518**].  He was severely
hypertensive with a blood pressure of 220/120 with EKG
showing sinus tachycardia and ST depressions.  His
cross-clamp showed a questionable widened mediastinum.  He
was started on a nitroglycerin drip.  His chest pain resolved
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 73**].  He was also given Lasix at [**Hospital3 2518**].  He was
also in the middle of a five-day course of amoxicillin and
prednisone for question of bronchitis.  He had had shortness
of breath and productive cough with green sputum x one week.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coronary artery disease with left
anterior descending coronary artery stent.  2. Status post
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  3. Status post myocardial
infarction.  4. Hypertension.  5. Bladder carcinoma with
prior chemotherapy course.  6. Question chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  7. Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Metoprolol.  2. Aspirin.  3.
Univasc.  4. Amoxicillin.  5. Prednisone.  6. Welchol
tablets.  7. Guaifenesin.  8. Nortriptyline.

He was admitted to the CMED service.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 131, K 4.3, chloride 93, CO2 23, BUN
13, creatinine 1.0, glucose 310, platelet count 279,000.
White count 10.6, hematocrit 46.9.  His INR was 1.4 on
admission with a PTT of 48.9 on heparin.  Chest x-ray did
show a poor study with the patient rotated and probable
congestive heart failure with a question of a widened
mediastinum.  His chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 182**] did not show congestive heart failure or
mediastinal widening.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 7300**]
service of cardiology who planned to have him catheterized.
He did have enzyme elevations in the setting of his
hypertension and known coronary artery disease.  There was
also a question of whether or not the patient had hepatitis.
His liver function tests were elevated with an alkaline
phosphatase of 166, ALT 101, AST 77, total bilirubin 0.58.
His INR had been elevated as previously mentioned.  It was
confirmed that he did have unstable angina and on the 14th he
was catheterized.  This showed 80% left main disease.  He was
seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7301**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7302**], cardiothoracic surgery fellow, who
noted his history.  His blood pressure at the time of
examination was 126/59 with a heart rate sinus in the 90s.
His neck had no bruits.  His heart was regular rate and
rhythm, no murmur.  His lungs had some rhonchi and wheezes
and he continued to cough during the examination.  His
abdomen was soft and nontender with some hepatomegaly.  His
extremities had good peripheral pulses and no varicosities.
The plan was to schedule him for bypass surgery once his
lungs cleared.

He was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14**] who noted that the need for
working up his liver function tests and INR was required
before surgery, and in addition to clearing his cough.  The
patient also noted to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14**] that he complained of a
persistent bleeding problem periodically, and he asked for
hematology consultation.  The patient was seen by hematology
who also noted that he had had hematuria post cystoscopy for
his bladder cancer and had been on aspirin.  Their
recommendations were discussed with cardiology.  The patient
continued to have an upper respiratory infection and over the
course of the next several days the patient also received a
GI consultation for working up his elevated liver enzymes.
The ultrasound of his right upper quadrant showed that the
left lobe of the liver had bulbous contour in sections 2 and
3, no definite mass, a simple cyst with normal flow.
Pancreas and spleen were unremarkable.  Please refer to the
GI report.  Their impression was that there was no clear
etiology and a question of whether this was alcohol induced.
There was no ascites on examination or splenomegaly but they
could not rule out significant fibrosis.  They recommended
getting a liver biopsy but that would require stopping his
anticoagulation so they recommended multiple laboratory tests
for a noninvasive approach first and possible MRI of the
liver to evaluate the hepatic vasculature.

Two days later his liver enzymes dropped to ALT of 62 and AST
of 70, total bilirubin 1.2 with an alkaline phosphatase of
116.  He was off nitroglycerin at that time secondary to a
headache and remained chest pain free.  He continued on his
Lopressor and aspirin and Welchol.  The mixing study from
hematology showed a factor deficiency.  The patient was given
vitamin K repletion with recommendations to give some fresh
frozen plasma preoperatively.  The GI service said possible
MRV.  His chronic obstructive pulmonary disease appeared to
be related to his bronchitis.  His lungs slowly started to
clear.  He continued on amoxicillin.

He was also seen by case management very early in his
hospitalization, on the 18th.

He had hepatomegaly with mildly elevated liver function
tests.  There was a question of cirrhosis versus metastatic
disease.  The plan was to try to get an MRI and MRV on the
19th.  He continued to receive vitamin K p.o.  He had a
little bit of hyponatremia with a sodium of 134.  He
continued to ambulate well on his own.  He had no complaints.
He was not having any chest pain at the time.

The MRI of his abdomen showed that the liver had a nodular
contour and enhanced heterogeneously.  He had a peripheral
area of increased arterial enhancement posteriorly in segment
6, which was nonspecific.  He had a few tiny cysts.  These
findings were consistent with cirrhosis and they have
recommended further follow up prior to his surgery.

The day prior to his operation he had a little bit of basilar
crackles but no wheezes.  He had no extremity edema.  His
white count was 8.8.  He had no chest pain.  He remained on a
heparin drip.  He also had some right lung base atelectasis.
Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia but a possible small pleural
effusion.  On the day prior to surgery he had completed seven
days of a seven-day course of amoxicillin.  His hyponatremia
resolved the following day.

On the 21st the patient underwent an off-pump coronary artery
bypass grafting x 4 by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 64**] with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary
artery, a vein graft to the diagonal, vein graft to obtuse
marginal and vein graft to the posterior descending coronary
artery.  It was determined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] that this was probably
a Child A class cirrhosis with a question of a factor
deficiency.  His ejection fraction was approximately 60% at
the time of operation.

On postoperative day one he was on an insulin drip at 1, a
Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.7 and propofol.  He received one
unit of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen
plasma overnight and his Plavix was started on postoperative
day one.  He remained intubated and sedated.  Postoperatively
he had a K of 4.5, BUN of 16, creatinine 0.6, a white count
of 10.4, hematocrit of 26.6 and a platelet count of 119,000.
He remained intubated and sedated.  He did wake up though.
He was on Neo-Synephrine.  His urine output was good.  He had
no other issues and all of his monitoring remained in place
as he stayed in the intensive care unit.

On postoperative day two he was awake and alert.  His heart
was regular rate and rhythm.  He started his Lopressor.
Plavix and aspirin continued.  His lungs were clear.  His
wounds were clean, dry and intact.  His beta blocker was
increased to 50 b.i.d. of Lopressor with a sinus tachycardia
of 105 and a blood pressure of 124/59.  He was saturating 93%
on four liters nasal cannula.  His Foley catheter was
discontinued.  His chest tubes were discontinued on
postoperative day three.  He was sitting up in bed.  He had
some crackles at the bases.  His dressings were clean, dry
and intact.  He had 1+ pitting edema in his left lower
extremity.  His hematocrit was stable in the high 20s.  K was
4.5 and blood sugar was 122.  He had a productive cough with
good O2 saturations.  His Lopressor was increased to 75
b.i.d. with a heart rate still in the 90s, sinus rhythm and a
good blood pressure.  He started his Lasix diuresis.  He had
a productive cough.  A Gram stain showed 4+ Gram negative
rods.  The patient was transferred out to the floor.  He was
seen by physical therapy on postoperative day five.  He had
no complaints.  He was saturating to 93% on two liters with a
heart rate of 86.  His lungs had some sparse crackles.  He
had a small amount of drainage on his sternal incision which
was serosanguinous and also at his lower leg incision,
otherwise the wounds were clean, dry and intact.  He
continued with physical therapy and received chest physical
therapy as needed.  His temperature was 97.2 with a blood
pressure of 125/72.

On postoperative day six the patient continued to have a
frequent productive cough.  He remained in sinus rhythm after
one run of atrial fibrillation the prior night.  His right
leg incision continued to have some drainage at the knee from
an old [**Location (un) 294**]-[**Location (un) 295**] drain site.  This site was sutured
closed by the cardiothoracic intern and Steri-Strips covered
the incision.  He continued on Levaquin for the Gram negative
rods in his lungs and continued to ambulate on the floor.  He
still had a cough on postoperative day seven and some sterile
sternal drainage with a sensation of sternal movement.  He
was at 79 in sinus rhythm and blood pressure 122/70,
saturating 94% on room air.  His heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  His lungs were clear bilaterally with some sparse
crackles.  He continued to have drainage from his right leg
[**Location (un) 294**]-[**Location (un) 295**] drain site around the sutures and Steri-Strips.
He continued to have a little bit of oozing around his
sternal incision and the plan was to take him back to the
operating room on the 29th where he underwent sternal
rewiring and debridement by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 64**].  Please refer
to the operative report.  The patient was able to have his
chest reclosed and the skin was reclosed with clips.  Chest
tubes remained in the left pleural space and one in the
mediastinum.  The patient went to the postanesthesia care
unit in stable condition.

When he was transferred to the floor later that day he had
good pain control with no complaints.  The incision was
clean, dry and intact.  His chest tube dressing was dry and
his chest tube had some serosanguinous drainage.  His right
leg dressing had very minimal drainage and he remained on his
prior medications.  He continued to contain of a little bit
of fatigue on postoperative day nine from his surgery and
postoperative day one from his rewiring.  He had an episode
of oliguria followed by some anuria for three or four hours
in the prior night.  He got some boluses or normal saline and
Hespan and one unit of packed red blood cells.  His period of
anuria coincided with blood pressure drop to about 80 mm
systolic.  The patient was believed to have been dehydrated
following two nights of n.p.o. with conservative hydration.
He continued to have a productive cough.  He had coarse
sounds throughout his lungs but with air movement.  His leg
incision continued to drain a small quantity of
serosanguinous fluid.  He continued to have chest physical
therapy and ambulated as tolerated.  He was on sternal
precautions.  He continued on vancomycin and Levaquin for
double antibiotic coverage.  Two days after his rewiring his
K was 5.0 with a BUN of 33 and a creatinine of 1.3 with a
white count of 10.8 and an hematocrit of 33.7.

He did have some pain issues with his sternal rewiring and
was switched to Dilaudid.  He had a PICC line placed on
[**10-30**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1580**] of radiology for a longer term
antibiotic therapy.  He continued on levofloxacin and
vancomycin.  He had some complaints of weakness.  He had
decreased breath sounds still with some coarseness.  The
incision was clean, dry and intact.  His right saphenectomy
site incision was clean, dry and intact.  He did have a
slightly cooler right foot.  He continued ambulating though
and had aggressive pulmonary toilet.  The PICC line was
placed in his right arm in radiology.  The patient was
followed every day by physical therapy.

Over the course of the next several days he continued to have
coarse breath sounds, a little bit of left lower extremity
serosanguinous oozing but no erythema.  His mediastinal chest
tube was pulled on [**11-1**].  His left pleural tube
remained in place.  He continued to have some pitting edema
from his thighs down and continuing rhonchi in his lungs,
also manifesting a little bit of depression over his
prolonged stay.

A chest x-ray on [**11-2**] showed a slight pneumothorax.
Chest tube was in place.  The patient was also seen by social
work.  His sternal wound on the 6th continued to start to
seep serosanguinous fluid at the inferior aspect.  His right
lower extremity also started to seep more serosanguinous
fluid.  This was noted to probably be from all of his edema
and the patient continued to be diuresed.  Case management
also met with the patient and his family again on the 6th.
The plan was if his sternal weeping stopped he would be able
to go home with visiting nurses and the family.  He continued
really not to have any complaints.  The patient had some
atrial fibrillation on the 6th and was started on amiodarone.
On the 8th this was decreased to 400 mg q.d. with a blood
pressure of 102/53.  Heart rate then converted into sinus
rhythm in the 70s with a maximum temperature of 98.1.  He
still had some leakage of his sternal incision.

A plastic surgery consultation was done on [**11-5**] for his
unstable sternum after the rewiring.  Cultures from his
surgery on [**10-27**] all were negative, no bacteria was cultured
out, and the question was whether or not plastic surgery
could go ahead and perform a flap.  The patient continued to
have scattered rhonchi.  The patient also continued to be up
8 kg from his preoperative weight with 1+ edema bilaterally.
His lower leg incision on the 9th was clean, dry and intact.
He was in sinus rhythm in the 60s and saturating 91% on room
air.  The plan was to make him n.p.o. so that he could go
back to the operating room to have the flap done.

On the 10th he was hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm.
His sternal wound had decreased serosanguinous fluid leak at
the inferior aspect but he continued to have 2+ edema in his
extremities.  He continued on his antibiotics and plastic
surgery took him to the operating room for sternal
debridement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] in attendance and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
from plastic surgery.  They did a right rectus abdominis flap
to the sternum with advancement to cover his sternal defect.
He received two units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of
packed cells.  He continued to have some rising PCO2
postoperatively.  Anesthesia was called to reintubate him
after the sternal debridement and he had some respiratory
failure.  He was reintubated in the evening of [**11-7**].
A left chest tube was placed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6473**] two
hours after his intubation.  His hematocrit was approximately
22 on the postoperative check by plastic surgery.  He
received two units of packed red blood cells, two units of
fresh frozen plasma.  He was transferred to the medical
intensive care unit.  The patient was somewhat agitated and
in restraints at the time.  He did have a pneumothorax
postoperatively which necessitated the chest tube placement.
His plastic incisions were covered with Tegaderm dressing.
There was some serosanguinous drainage to his dressing.
Three [**Location (un) 294**]-[**Location (un) 295**] drains were in place along his sternal
flaps and his abdominal advancement sites.  His abdomen was
tender.  The total of the [**Location (un) 294**]-[**Location (un) 295**] drainage was 650 cc.
A new right radial artery line was placed for hemodynamic
monitoring in the medical intensive care unit on the 10th
also.

He continued to have some oozing from his [**Location (un) 294**]-[**Location (un) 295**]
drains.  These remained on suction.  The patient was
transfused with a repeat hematocrit to be checked.  The
patient had a systolic blood pressure drop to 75 at 11
o'clock in the evening.  The medical intensive care unit team
was able to place the right radial line.  Blood pressure was
in the 70s.  The patient received intravenous crystalloid
resuscitation and a third unit of packed red blood cells.
The blood pressure rose in response to the intravenous
fluids.  Blood gas at 11 PM was 7.19/57/204/23/-6.
Hematocrit was 26.2 which was a rise of one point from his
first postoperative hematocrit.  He appeared to be in
hypovolemic or septic shock at that point.  Two more units of
packed red blood cells stat and two units of fresh frozen
plasma were given.  A right brachial arterial line was
unsuccessful placement.  A left brachial arterial line was
placed.  The patient continued to have 320 cc of
[**Location (un) 294**]-[**Location (un) 295**] drainage.  More laboratory studies were sent at
2 AM.  Levophed was added to maintain a blood pressure of
over 60 at 1 AM.  The FIO2 was increased, intravenous fluids
were increased.  The patient's respiratory rate rose
slightly.  Bicarbonate was given.  Further resuscitation was
given with red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and cryo.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2558**] arrived at 2 AM.  The plastic
surgery team was called and updated.  A left subclavian
Cordis and PA catheter was placed and a right femoral venous
Cordis was placed.  With ongoing and worsening bleeding from
the [**Doctor Last Name **] drains at about a liter an hour the decision was
made to continue the blood product transfusion and take back
to the operating room for reexploration of bleeding/control
and possible packing of the wound.  The family was contacted
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**].

The patient was also seen by the renal fellow on the 10th.
The patient was requiring epinephrine drip at 1, Levophed at
0.15.  Milrinone had been started at 0.15 and a Pitressin
drip at 0.3.  The patient received several amps of sodium
bicarbonate in addition to the fresh frozen plasma, red blood
cells, cryo, and platelets that he had received.  He remained
intubated and sedated with some anasarca surrounding his
hemorrhage events and the question was whether he had septic
shock and then produced an anuric drop in his renal status.
He continued to receive respiratory support with a corrected
lactic acidosis secondary to a likely ischemic flap and other
tissues that may have been hypoperfused.  He likely had ATN
secondary to the hypotension.  His INR at that point was 1.3
with a PT of 13.9 a D-dimer of over 2,000 and fibrin of 155.
His CK was 180 with a troponin of less than 0.3.  His AST was
2,653, ALT 871, alkaline phosphatase 52.  His lactic acidosis
was 11.7, down from 16.6.  He had an hematocrit of 34.0,
platelet count of 111,000.  CVVHD was initiated.  He did not
receive any special anticoagulation for the CVVHD.  Please
refer to the renal note.

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 7303**] was gravely ill on the 11th after the lactic
acidosis and hypotension.  His hemodynamics were consistent
with sepsis.  He continued to ooze blood from multiple sites.
He had a regular rate and rhythm in his heart but continued
to have rhonchi of his lungs and anasarca of his extremities.
CVVHD was initiated for management of his acid base imbalance
and volume control.

Hematology/oncology were also consulted again for his rising
PTT and extensive postoperative bleeding.  Please refer to
the note.  It appeared that the patient was manifesting now
some coagulopathies with a question of DIC.  He continued to
receive cryo to keep his fibrinogen up.  He received fresh
frozen plasma to help correct his PTT.  He received platelets
to help increase his platelet count and keep it above
100,000.  He was given factor VIIa.

He was seen again by the renal fellow.  His calcium was
repleted.  His CVVHD was restarted.  The filter clotted the
following morning and was replaced and then restarted for
some fluid management.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 6704**]1th he did return to the operating room because of
the coagulopathy and massive incisional hemorrhage.  He was
reexplored and packed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of
cardiothoracic surgery.  Prior to the 11th he did have some
large volumes of blood products as previously noted, as well
as inotropic agents.  He did develop some bradycardia.  His
severe acidosis was noted.  On the 11th an urgent
transesophageal echocardiogram was done which demonstrated
poor ventricular function.  There was also evidence of air
entering the left-sided cardiac [**Doctor Last Name **].  He was transferred
emergently to the operating room for reexploration and to
rule out the cause of the air entering the left side of the
heart.  This was done on [**11-8**]. There was some evidence
of ongoing bleeding.  On reexploration there was fibrous
healing at the base of the incision which precluded any
direct connection between the incision on the left side of
the heart.  It seemed more that the air seen in the cardiac
[**Doctor Last Name **] on the left side was probably from peripheral
pulmonary injury from a previously placed chest tube and not
from any pathology in the sternal incision.  There was a good
return of ventricular function.  The incision was then
repacked at this time utilizing large nylon sutures to
bolster the packing against the sternal edges.  This achieved
better hemostasis.  This was done up and down the full length
of the incisions.  Chest tubes were again placed within the
incision.  The area was covered again with an Ioban dressing.
Please refer to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] operative note.

On the 12th the patient remained on an epinephrine drip at
0.26, Levophed drip at 1.0, Neo-Synephrine drip at 3.0,
insulin drip at 6, Pitressin drip at 0.5.  His PO2 continued
to decrease overnight with his acidosis.  He remained
sedated.  He had very swollen distal extremities.  He
continued to have his open chest and continued with
ventilatory support for management of his oxygenation.  He
continued to be critically ill in the intensive care unit.

On the 12th the patient did have a cessation of the bleeding
however he appeared to be slightly jaundiced with anasarca of
his extremities.  His white count was 15.1, hematocrit of
36.7, BUN of 23, creatinine of 2.1, an INR of 1.2, PT of
13.5.  His albumin was 3.3.  His coagulation studies
continued to improve and his factor VII was discontinued.  He
was also screened by the clinical nutrition team.  He was
seen again by plastic surgery that afternoon.  His wounds
were continued to be filled with Ioban drapes and he remained
critically ill.  On the 12th he also received CVVHD again and
continued to be followed closely by the renal service.  He
continued on vancomycin.  Zosyn had been started for more
complete antibiotic coverage.  He started on hydrocortisone
steroid therapy.  His coagulopathy continued to be
aggressively treated.  He had intermittent atrial
fibrillation with a blood pressure of 102/31 and it ranged
also down to 71/34.  He remained on an epinephrine drip,
Levophed drip and Neo-Synephrine and Pitressin intravenous
support.  He remained unresponsive.  His chest continued to
be packed.  He had coarse breath sounds.  His belly was
packed.  He continued to be very edematous.  He had
dopplerable PT and DP pulses bilaterally.  He had no changes
otherwise in his systems.  He continued to be seen by plastic
surgery.

On the 13th his CVVHD filter clotted again.  It was restarted
after a line change.  He continued on quadruple pressor
support and an insulin drip at a rate of 36.  He also
continued on double antibiotic therapy of Zosyn and
vancomycin and continued on hydrocortisone 50 t.i.d.  His INR
rose to 1.7 with a PT of 16, a white count of 22.2, platelet
count dropped to 86,000.  His creatinine rose to 2.4.  His
liver enzymes continued to be extremely elevated.  His Swan
numbers also were consistent with septic shock which may have
been the nidus for his DIC.  Please refer to the renal note.
At that point on examination his ears were cyanotic.  His
feet were mottled and his chest and abdomen around his flaps
were mottled also.

On the 13th the patient was seen by the liver fellow for his
abnormal liver function tests and a question of liver
failure.  He did again note his chronic alcohol consumption.
The patient at that time admitted only to approximately two
drinks per day.  He continued on amiodarone for atrial
fibrillation.  His beta blocker was held.  He continued on
double antibiotic therapy with Plavix and the quadruple
pressor support.  His insulin drip was stopped later in the
day.  The assessment was that it was probably liver shock
secondary to his profound hypotension, DIC and massive blood
product infusion, although related infection could also be a
possibility.  They recommended continuing his blood product
support and his vitamin K 10 mg subcutaneous.  The hepatology
attending saw no role at that time for extracorporeal liver
circulation.  He thought that this would not change the
patient's outcome and his prognosis was very grave given the
shock liver on his background cirrhosis.

Hematology also saw him on [**11-10**] with the
recommendation to continue the aggressive coagulopathy
treatment.  Please refer to their note.  The patient
continued to receive fresh frozen plasma and platelets.  He
did get hypoglycemic to the 30s.  A D10 drip was given.  He
continued to have cyanosis in his peripheral tissues of ears,
lips and nose.  His Levophed was weaned off but he remained
on an epinephrine drip at 0.26, a Neo-Synephrine drip at 3.0
and a Pitressin drip at 0.18.  He also remained on Zosyn
antibiotic therapy and hydrocortisone t.i.d.  His liver
enzymes continued to be extremely elevated and continued on
CVVHD.

On [**11-11**] the patient remained on vancomycin and Zosyn
and triple pressor support with a heart rate of 106 in atrial
fibrillation, maximum temperature of 99.5, blood pressure
93/27 which was aggressively treated.  The patient continued
to receive fresh frozen plasma and platelets as needed.  He
continued with pressor support and antibiotic therapy, and
ventilatory support.  Attempts were made to correct his
acidosis.

He was seen again by plastic surgery on [**11-11**].  They
continued to follow him and recognized the supportive care
that was being given.

He was seen by urology on [**11-12**] in the morning.  They
were called for gross hematuria.  A three-way Foley catheter
was in place with gross red blood at that point.  That
started in the morning.  Their impression was that there was
gross venous bleeding likely from his prostatic urethra.
They recommended traction on the Foley catheter for six hours
and then allowing it to drain to gravity.  The patient was
discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of urology.  The patient
continued to be a little bit hypoglycemic for which he had
received a D10 drip and he continued in extremely critical
condition on [**11-12**].  He continued to have hematuria.
He remained on his triple pressor support.  He was extremely
edematous, remained sedated.  His lips became darkly
discolored.  His scrotum continued to swell.  His chest and
belly remained packed.  He did have dopplerable pulses in his
extremities.  His white count was 12.1 with an hematocrit of
27.  On the 15th his K was 4.4 with a BUN of 21, creatinine
of 1.5.  His vancomycin was being dosed by level.  He was in
atrial fibrillation in the high 90s with a blood pressure of
103/31.  Gas in the morning was 7.4/47/93/30/2.  He was
transfused another unit of fresh frozen plasma and red blood
cells as well as platelets.  He continued on TPN which had
been started for nutritional support and his amiodarone drip
for atrial fibrillation.  His urine was clear after the
traction.  There was no bleeding at the meatus.  His scrotum
was unchanged in size with no change in his skin breakdown at
all by urology.  This was noted on the morning of the 15th.
they recommended not changing his Foley and allowing it to
remain in place, at least for another 24 hours before that.
They recommended Xeroform and Adaptic to the scrotum at that
time.  He started to have ventricular ectopy and the
amiodarone drip was continued.  He had a slight improvement
in his anion gap which may have been related to his
underlying ischemic lactic acidosis having a small
improvement.  The patient remained critically ill in atrial
fibrillation with multiple premature ventricular contractions
and couplets and runs of threes.  He also had several long
pauses which dropped his rate from the 100s to 70.  He
continued on Neo-Synephrine and epinephrine and vasopressin.
His index was hyperdynamic.  His temperature was low in the
35.4 to 36.5 range.  A Bair Hugger was on.  He had minimal
drainage from his chest tubes.  His breath sounds were
diminished without.  He had no changes in his vent settings
overnight.  His acidosis was corrected.  His arterial blood
gases were acceptable with a PO2 of 93.

He started to bleed more from his Foley catheter despite the
normal saline irrigation.  The urology resident came in and
irrigated his catheter with a new larger three-way and
applied pressure and traction.  The bleeding slowed, as per
the plan that was discussed and then placed to drainage.

At 9:25 on the 15th he continued to have significantly more
ventricular ectopy with couplets, multifocals and short runs
of ventricular tachycardia.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] was at the bedside.
The Swan was removed without any improvement and an
additional amiodarone bolus was given.  Magnesium drip was
started.  Calcium was repleted.  Defibrillator pads were
applied to his chest with a transvenous pacer at his bedside.
Two hours later the patient continued to have significant
ectopy.  Amiodarone drip continued.  The patient nodded to
pain when his chest was touched.  Morphine was given
sparingly at that point.  The patient started to bleed from
his nose and his mouth but his urine was now clear after
irrigation.  Continuing aggressive attempts to correct the
coagulopathy were done with multiple units of fresh frozen
plasma, packed red blood cells and platelet infusions.  The
patient remained markedly jaundices.  His abdominal and
sternal packings were unchanged.  His skin was in very poor
condition with mottled ears and toes, and massive anasarca.
He was weeping icteric fluid from all skin tears and puncture
sites.  He did tolerate his CVVHD at that time.  He had some
suctioning for minimal icteric noted bloody secretions.  He
had very distant noisy breath sounds.  His chest tubes had
scant dark red drainage.  He continued on his pressor support
with his blood pressure hovering around 90 despite the volume
administration.

At 6 PM he had a multi-beat run of self-limiting ventricular
tachycardia despite the amiodarone with occasional premature
ventricular contractions.  The decision was made by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**]
to try lidocaine.  An intravenous bolus was given which
dropped the patient's heart rate into the 40s to 60s range
and then he went back into atrial fibrillation and flutter
with a blood pressure of 85.  He was minimally responsive to
continuing blood products and vasopressin.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] was
updated repeatedly via telephone.  Three attempts at
cardioversion were made without success.  The patient
remained in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with a
rate in the 60s to 80s range.  The amiodarone was turned off.
The patient was grimacing more to tactile and verbal
stimulation, especially from his family.  He moved his feet
when touched but not to command.  His left subclavian Cordis
was changed over a wire for leakage without any incident.
There was some oozing from the site which was packed with
Surgicel.  Urine output was slightly increased from the day
prior with no bleeding at this time after the irrigation.

On postoperative day 26/6 and 5 he remained on vancomycin and
Zosyn.  He was on epinephrine at 0.26, Neo-Synephrine at 3,
Pitressin at 0.04 and amiodarone at 1.  He had a blood
pressure of 88/26.  He was saturating only 86% with a
respiratory rate of 22 with ventilatory support.  His heart
rate was in the 60s in atrial fibrillation with additional
premature ventricular contractions.  He continued on steroid
therapy.  As noted there were three cardioversion attempts
and an attempt at lidocaine drip.  The amiodarone drip was
discontinued.  There was no obvious bleeding at that time but
the patient was suffering from significant hypoxia.  His
lactate was greater than 30.  His blood gas showed a pH of
7.29/50/60/25/-2 at that time.  His heart rate was very
irregular.  His breath sounds were extremely coarse.  His
abdomen was soft but packed with the dressings.  His
extremities remained extremely swollen but they were warm to
the touch.  His Foley catheter remained in place along with
his Cordis monitoring and triple lumens.  He continued his
CVVHD and antibiotic therapy at that time and continued his
pressor support although it was noted that he was failing.
With the patient's failing blood pressure and the noted
coagulopathies which continued to be treated aggressively,
the patient continued to have ventricular ectopy on the
morning of the 16th while the team was rounding.  The patient
continued to have repeat episodes of ventricular arrhythmias
and really lost his tone, became acutely hypotensive, in
addition to his chronic hypotensiveness, and a code was
called on the morning of the 16th.  The patient became
asystolic ultimately, was treated and did not respond, and
the patient was pronounced dead in the intensive care unit on
the morning of [**11-13**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 39 year old
male found down next to his bike without a helmet.  There
were no witnesses.  There was a presumed biking accident.
[**Location (un) 1300**] Coma Scale 3 at the scene.  The patient was intubated
and taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital where he was given Narcan with
no effect.  At [**Location (un) **] emergency room patient was moving
upper extremities.  Hemodynamically stable as per their
nursing record.  Patient was found to have a large, right,
frontotemporal, subdural hemorrhage approximately 7 mm thick
with shift, effacement and tentorial, somatic, subarachnoid
hemorrhage.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 182**] to Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 7532**] service for emergency
craniotomy evacuation of subdural hemorrhage and placement of
ICP monitor intraoperatively.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was monitored in the trauma
SICU overnight.  Postoperatively he was localizing with both
upper extremities briskly.  Pupils were briskly reactive and
symmetric bilaterally.  Patient was moving his right leg
spontaneously.  The left leg was not moving postoperatively.
Repeat head CT postoperatively revealed good evacuation of
subdural hematoma.  Patient was started on ventilator wean
and weaned off sedation on [**7-4**].  Patient's Ancef was
discontinued on [**7-4**].  Patient's ICP bolt discontinued on
[**7-6**].  Patient's neurologic weakness improved during course
of hospital stay.  Left lower extremity was 3+/5 to [**2-28**] on
both dorsi and plantar flexion on day of discharge.

The patient's mental status improved status post surgery.
Patient was initially agitated and very confused
postoperatively.  Patient became more calm [**MD Number 1348**] hospital
stay, but remained confused at times.  C-spine x-rays were
performed on [**7-8**] which were negative.  Patient was cleared
to have collar removed at that time.  On [**7-9**] the patient was
placed on Haldol p.r.n. agitation.  He has not required

ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Mr. [**Known patient lastname 571**] is a 34-year-old
gentleman who was hit by a motor vehicle at approximately 30
to 40 miles per hour while walking across the street.  At the
scene, per report by emergency medical services, the patient
was known to have suffered significant head trauma with his
head penetrating the windshield.  He was also noted to have
been covered in emesis with concern for possible aspiration.
In the field, there was difficulty obtaining an airway and he
was anoxic for sometime.  The patient was brought to the
emergency room at the [**Hospital1 87**] in
extremis.  On initial presentation, the patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 572**]
Coma Scale score of 3.  His hemodynamics were quite unstable,
and in fact the patient experienced cardiac arrest twice in
the trauma bay for which he was resuscitated.  While in the
trauma bay, the patient was found to have extensive facial
injuries in addition to a left pneumothorax which required
emergent tube thoracostomy.  His FAST exam was positive for
fluid in the abdomen around the area of the spleen, and he
was noted to have multiple injuries of his right lower
extremity and right hip.  The patient was aggressively
resuscitated in the trauma bay, and the decision was made to
obtain a CT scan of the head to determine if there was such
severe brain injury that further intervention would not have
been indicated.  After stabilization, he was emergently taken
to the CT scanner.  The CT scan of the head did not show
evidence of significant intracranial bleeding, and therefore
he was emergently taken to the operating room for exploratory
laparotomy for likely splenic injury.  At the time of
laparotomy, he was in fact found to have a shattered spleen
which was removed.  The bleeding was controlled.  Please
refer to the operative note for further details.  The patient
was taken to the trauma surgical intensive care unit where he
was stabilized with aggressive fluid resuscitation and packed
red blood cell transfusion for blood loss anemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurologic:  As noted, the patient's
initial GCS score was 3.  There was a significant period of
anoxia en route prior to establishment of a secure airway.
The patient initially demonstrated very little neurologic
activity with the exception of some intact brain stem
reflexes.  The neurology service was consulted, and after
further imaging of the head the patient was found to have
evidence of diffuse axonal injury.  The neurosurgery felt
that he would likely remain in a persistent vegetative state
without significant likelihood of neurologic recovery.  Based
on these findings combined with the family's knowledge that
the patient had previously made clear he would not want to
remain on advanced life support for any extended period of
time, the family decided that the patient would want the life
support removed.  This was done on [**3306-12-14**], after
the family had agreed to organ transplantation, and the
patient was taken for organ procurement that day.

Respiratory:  The patient had significant thorax injuries
including pulmonary contusions which required mechanical
ventilation.  His pneumothorax resolved after placement of
the left chest tube in the trauma bay.

Cardiovascular:  The patient's hemodynamics after the initial
stabilization phase remained somewhat stable.  He
subsequently did not manifest any dysrhythmias after the
initial episodes of cardiac arrest in the trauma bay.

Gastrointestinal:  The patient was maintained on an H2
antagonist for stress ulcer prophylaxis.  He was otherwise
not noted to have any injuries of the abdominal viscera other
than the spleen.

Endocrine:  Although the patient did not carry a prior
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, his blood sugars were in
excess of 500 mg/dL, and his acid base status indicated that
he was in some degree of diabetic ketoacidosis.  His blood
sugars were aggressively controlled with an intravenous
insulin drip.  [**Last Name (un) 573**] Diabetes was consulted and provided
assistance in managing this.

Renal:  The patient's renal status remained stable throughout
the course of his hospitalization.

Infectious disease:  The patient was noted to have aspirated
at the scene, and subsequently upon serial chest radiographs
was found to have developed what was consistent with an
aspiration pneumonia.  Sputum cultures demonstrated gram-
negative rods which were treated with Zosyn.

Hematologic:  The patient suffered from blood loss anemia as
a result of his traumatic injuries.  He was transfused with
packed red blood cells.  His hematocrit had stabilized
subsequent to his emergent splenectomy.  Deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis was initiated with sequential
compression devices.  Subcutaneous heparin was held given the
recent bleeding.

FINAL DISPOSITION:  As noted previously, after the patient's
splenectomy and operative repair of his orthopedic injuries,
the patient's hemodynamic and overall status did stabilize,
but given the extent of his traumatic brain injury and the
likelihood that the he would likely not return to a
significant functional baseline status, the patient's family
decided that his wishes would be for removal of artificial
life support and for donation of his organs for
transplantation.  This was performed on [**3306-12-14**], at
which time the patient was pronounced.

HISTORY:  This patient's name after discharge is [**Last Name (un) 7423**], last
name Mulay. She is a now one week old former 32 5/7 weeks
gestation preterm infant now 33 5/7 weeks post menstrual age.
She is twin #2 of a twin gestation pregnancy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This mother is a 31-year-old G1,
P0. This was an in [**Last Name (un) 22**] fertilization pregnancy resulting in
amniotic dichorionic twins. Prenatal screens were blood type
B+, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
hepatitis B surface antigen negative, group beta strep status
negative. The mother's pregnancy was complicated by cervical
dilatation requiring hospitalization from 23 weeks gestation.
She received a course of betamethasone at 24 weeks of
gestation. On the day of delivery, she was found to be 6 cm
dilated and having vaginal bleeding. She was taken to the
primary cesarean section. Twin #2 emerged vigorous with Apgar
of 7 at one minute and 8 at five minutes. She required
routine care in the delivery room with blow by O2. She was
admitted to the neonatal Intensive Care Unit for treatment of
prematurity. There were no risk factors or concerns for
chorioamnionitis. Mother's medical history and family history
is noncontributory.

Measurements upon admission to the neonatal Intensive Care
Unit, weight was 1.360 kg 15% percentile, length 41 cm 30%,
head circumference 28 cm 45% percentile.

length 41.5 cm, head circumference 28 cm. General:
Nondysmorphic, nondistressed preterm female in room air in an
isolette. Skin: Warm and dry. Color pink. Well perfused.
Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat: Anterior fontanelle opened
and level. Sagittal suture overriding. Oral mucosa clear.
Palate intact. Alert gaze. Positive red reflex bilaterally.
Chest: Breath sounds are clear and equal. No work of
breathing. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No
murmur. Normal S1 and S2. Femoral pulses are +2. Abdomen:

preterm female without anomaly. Spine: Straight with normal
sacrum. Extremities: Moving all straight with normal digits,
nails and creases. Hips stable. Neurological: Quietly alert,
positive grasp, symmetric tone.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory: This infant has been on room air since
    admission and through her entire neonatal Intensive Care
    Unit admission. She has had rare episodes of spontaneous
    apnea and bradycardia not requiring treatment other than
    monitoring. At the time of discharge, she is breathing
    comfortably on room air with a respiratory rate of 30-60
    breaths per minute.
2. Cardiovascular: This infant has maintained normal heart
    rates and blood pressures. No murmurs have been noted.
    At the time of discharge, baseline heart rate is 130-150
    beats per minute with a reasonable blood pressure of
    66/53 mmHg and mean arterial pressure of 57 mmHg.
3. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: This infant was
    initially NPO and maintained on parenteral nutrition.
    Enteral feeds were started on day of life #1 and
    gradually advanced to full volume. At the time of
    discharge, she is receiving 150 ml per kilo per day of
    breast milk or premature Enfamil 20 calorie per ounce
    formula. Weight on the day of discharge is 1.335 kg.
    Serum electrolytes were checked on day of life 2 and
    were within normal limits. The infant has maintained
    normal urine output.
4. Infectious disease: Due to her prematurity, this infant
    was evaluated for sepsis upon admission to the neonatal
    Intensive Care Unit. A complete blood count had a white
    count of 8,600 with a differential of 12%
    polymorphonuclear cells, 0% band neutrophils due to the
    slightly low absolute neutrophil count. This infant was
    started on intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. The
    blood culture was no growth at 48 hours and the
    antibiotics were discontinued.
5. Hematological: The hematocrit at birth was 44.5%. This
    infant has not received any transfusions of blood
    products.
6. Gastrointestinal: This infant required treatment for
    unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy. Peak
    serum bilirubin occurred on day of life 3, total 6.7
    mg/dl. She received approximately 48 hours of
    phototherapy and initial re-eval bilirubin was 5.8
    mg/dl. A repeat on [**2718-2-4**] had a total of 7.5
    mg/dl and phototherapy was restarted.
7. Neurological: This infant has maintained a normal
    neurological exam d[**MD Number 149**] admission and there were no
    neurological concerns at the time of discharge. By
    gestational age criteria, she would not require a head
    ultrasound, but the less than 1500 gm, a head ultrasound
    should be considered.
8. Sensory:
Audiology: Hearing screening has not yet been performed and
is recommended prior to discharge.
This infant meets criteria for a screening exam for
retinopathy of prematurity due to her birth weight less than
1500 grams. Her first exam would be due the week of [**2718-2-11**].
1. Psychosocial: [**Hospital1 4**]
    Social Work has been involved with this family. The
    contact social worker is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 166**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2276**] and she can be
    reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 23**].
2. Condition at discharge is stable.
3. Discharge disposition: Transfer to [**Hospital3 9965**] for continuing level II care. The primary
    pediatrician has not yet been identified.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Feeding: 150 ml per kilo per day of breast milk or
    preemie Enfamil 20 calorie per ounce formula.
2. No medications.
3. Iron/vitamin D supplementation:
Iron supplementation is recommended for preterm and low birth
weight infants until 12 months corrected age.
All infants fed predominantly breast milk should receive
vitamin D supplementation at 200 international units (may be
provided as a multivitamin preparation) daily until 12 months
corrected age.
1. Car seat position screening is recommended prior to
    discharge.
2. State newborn screen was sent on [**2718-1-31**] with
    no notification of abnormal results to date.
3. Immunizations: No immunizations administered thus far.
4. Immunizations recommended:
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from November
through March for infants who may meet any of the following
four criteria: First, born at less than 32 weeks; second,
born between 32 and 35 0/7 weeks with the two of the
following: Daycare during RSV, smoker in the household,
neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age
siblings; thirdly, chronic lung disease or fourth,
hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Influenzae immunization is recommended annually in the fall
for all infants once they reach 6 months of age. Before this
age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,
immunization for influenzae is recommended for household
contacts and out of home care givers.
This infant has not received rotavirus vaccine. The American
Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial vaccination of
preterm infants at or following discharge from the hospital
if they are clinical stable and at least 6 weeks but fewer
than 12 weeks of age.

normal limits.  Infant has not received any immunizations to
date (Hep B was deferred to coordinate vaccines with first
twin).  Immunizations are recommended.

IMMUNIZATIONS:
1. Finish RSV prophylaxis should be considered for November
    through March if any of the following 4 criteria:  1)
    Born at less than 32 weeks; 2) Born between 32 and 35
    weeks with 2 of the following.  They occur during RSV
    fusion, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular
    disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; 3)
    Chronic lung disease or; 4) Hemodynamically significant
    congestive heart disease.
2. Influenza immunizations recommended in the fall for all
    infants once they reach 6 months of age.  Before this
    age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,
    immunization against influenza is recommended for
    household contacts and at a phone caregivers.
3. This infant has not received rotavirus vaccine.
    Pediatrics recommends initial vaccination of preterm
    infants at birth following discharge from the hospital
    if they are clinical stable, 6 weeks but fewer than 12
    weeks of age.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Premature twin born at 34 weeks, mild
respiratory distress syndrome, rule out sepsis with
antibiotics, mild hyperbilirubinemia, apnea bradycardia of
prematurity resolved.

[**Hospital3 27**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10141**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known patient lastname 10142**] is the
former 805 g product of a 26-5/7 week gestation pregnancy
born to a 28-year-old, gravida 4, para 2, now 3, woman.
Prenatal screens blood type A+, antibody negative, rubella
immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, group Beta-strep status unknown. The maternal
history is notable for [**Doctor Last Name 691**] disease treated with PTU. This
pregnancy was complicated by multiple episodes of bacterial
vaginosis for which she was treated with Metrogel. There was
an interpregnancy interval of 8 months between this pregnancy
and the previous pregnancy. There was a prenatal diagnosis
made of gastroschisis. The mother had preliminary interview
with the advanced fetal care center at [**Hospital3 27**]
but her intensive appointment with scans was due at 28 weeks.
The mother was admitted on the day prior to delivery with
premature rupture of membranes. She had a cerclage in place
that was managed expectantly. She was treated with ampicillin
and gentamicin and erythromycin and received a dose of
betamethasone prior to delivery. There was noted fetal
tachycardia without fever. Induction of labor was undertaken
but mother was taken to cesarean section after failure of the
induction. The infant emerged limp with a low heart rate and
minimal respiratory effort. He was intubated in the delivery
room with a 2.5 French endotracheal tube. [**Hospital3 27**]
Surgical Team was present and placed a silo over the
abdominal wall defect containing the extruded bowel. Apgar
scores were 5 at one minute and 7 at five minutes. He was
transported to the neonatal intensive care unit for further
treatment and management.

Anthropometric measurements upon admission to the neonatal
intensive care unit: Weight 805 g, 25th percentile, length
45.5 cm, 25-50th percentile, head circumference 25 cm, 50th
percentile.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: Weight 804 g,
general nondysmorphic, preterm male, intubated on ventilator
support. Skin warm and dry. Open areas around the base of the
abdominal wall at the site of the gastroschisis. There is
oozing of serous fluid from the area. Otherwise, infant is
pink and well perfused. Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat:
Anterior fontanel open and flat. Intact red reflux
bilaterally. Palate intact. Orally intubated. Chest: Breath
sounds equal. Well aerated. Spontaneous respirations with
good air excursion. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmur. Normal S1 and S2. Pulses +2. Abdomen: Visible,
pink bowel loops in place within the silo. Referred bowel
sounds through the rest of the abdomen. Three-vessel
umbilical cord to the left of the abdominal wall defect. GU:
Normal preterm male. Testes high in the canals. Anus patent.
Musculoskeletal: Spine midline. Extremities: With normal
digits, nails and creases. Neurologic: Tone and reflexes
consistent with gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By systems including pertinent laboratory
data:
1. Respiratory: The infant was treated with 2 doses of
    surfactant. His initial ventilatory settings were a peak
    inspiratory pressure of 22, positive-end expiratory
    pressure of 5, intermittent mandatory ventilatory rate
    of 30 and 60% fractional of expired oxygen. He has
    weaned over the course of his first 5 days of life to
    pressures of peak inspiratory pressure of 18, positive
    and expiratory pressure of 5, intermittent mandatory
    respiratory rate of 20 and baseline oxygen requirement
    of room air. His most recent arterial gas is a pH of
    7.26, carbon dioxide of 52 and pO2 of 97. Chest x-ray
    was notable for mild granular changes consistent with
    surfactant deficiency, endotracheal in good position.
2. Cardiovascular: A tibial arterial line was placed for
    arterial access. This infant has maintained stable heart
    rates and blood pressures. On day of life #1, he was
    noted to have an episode of bounding pulses and very
    active precordium. He was treated presumptively with a
    course of indomethacin. A cardiac echocardiogram was
    performed on [**2713-12-16**], that showed no PTA, a
    small PFO, normal structure and function. At the time of
    discharge, his baseline heart rate is 140-160 beats per
    minute with mean arterial blood pressures of 32-36 mmHg.
3. Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition: This infant has been
    maintained NPO. Percutaneously inserted central catheter
    was placed on day of life 1 with the tube in the left
    subclavian vein. The infant has been receiving total
    parenteral nutrition of 9% glucose and protein to give
    3.5 g/kg/day. He has a supplemental line of 5% dextrose
    in water. Serum glucoses have varied from 80s to 180s,
    most recent 155 mg/dl. He has not been weighed since
    birth due to the instability of his bowel within the
    silo. He has maintained urine output of 3-4 cc/kg/hr.
    Most recent set of electrolytes from [**2713-12-18**],
    has a serum sodium of 135, a potassium of 3.7, chloride
    of 102 pCO2 of 22. He had a serum albumin of 2.0. serum
    triglyceride level on [**2713-12-18**], is 81. Recent
    BUN and creatinine with BUN of 33, creatinine of 0.7.
4. Infectious disease: This infant was evaluated for sepsis
    upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. His
    initial white blood cell count was 7700 with a
    differential of 8% polymorphonuclear cells, 2% band,
    neutrophils were in absolute neutrophil count of 616. A
    blood cultures was obtained prior starting intravenous
    ampicillin and gentamicin. Repeat CBC on day of life 2
    had a white blood cell count of 7900 and an improved
    differential of 28% polymorphonuclear cells, 3% band
    neutrophils. The plan was for a 1-week course of
    antibiotics. Gentamicin levels at the third dose had a
    trough level of 1.6 and peak level of 8.2 mg/dl. Repeat
    gentamicin level with the fourth dose had a trough level
    of 1.3. The infant is receiving bacitracin ointment to
    the base of the abdominal wall surrounding the
    gastroschisis.
5. Hematological: Hematocrit at birth was 53%. The platelet
    count of 209,000. Repeat hematocrit of day of life #3
    was 31%. The infant received a packed red blood cell
    transfusion of 20 ml/kg on [**2713-12-16**]. The infant
    is blood type A+ and is direct antibody test negative.
    Repeat platelet count on day of life 2 was 159,000.
6. Gastrointestinal: As previously noted, this infant has a
    gastroschisis. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] was placed and drained small
    amounts of dark green bilious fluid. The silo placed at
    the time of delivery remains intact with tension to be
    maintained at a perpendicular angle to the abdominal
    wall. The bowel has remained well perfused. The infant
    required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
    with phototherapy. Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day
    of life 4, total 5.3 mg/dl. Serum bilirubin on [**12-18**], 2007, is total 4.4 mg/dl, direct 0.5 mg/dl, indirect
    3.9 mg/dl.
7. Neurology: This infant has maintained an appropriate
    neurological exam. He had a head ultrasound performed on
    [**2713-12-15**], with results within normal limits. He
    received fentanyl intravenously for pain and sedation.
8. Sensory: Hearing screen has not been performed and as
    recommended prior to discharge.
9. Ophthalmology: This infant will require screening
    ophthalmology exams for retinopathy of prematurity. His
    eyes have not yet been examined.
10.Psychosocial: This is an intact couple. There are
    siblings 6 years old and 8 months old. The family has
    been very involved in visiting and caring for their son.

Addendum:
A preliminary discharge summary, written by the covering intern 
but not yet reviewed by the attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1504**] originally 
sent to [**Hospital1 **] with the patient. The attending review showed 
that it contained two errors: it did not list allopurinol as one 
of his home medications, and it improperly stated his code 
status. His proper code status through this admission and on 
discharge (and confirmed with a transport DNR/DNI sheet signed 
by patient and intern) was DNR/DNI.
.
The errors and updated correct information were discussed 
verbally with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5495**] RN on [**3001-6-29**], who stated that she 
verbally updated the covering physician at that time; and an 
updated discharge summary was received by the [**Hospital1 **] facility in the afternoon of Monday [**3001-6-29**] by 
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5495**] RN, and put in the chart then. This was confirmed
